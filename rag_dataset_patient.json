2023bone cancer basics \" the bone bone cancer includes a group of cancers that start in the bone or cartilage. this is called primary bone cancer and differs from other types of cancers that can spread or metastasize to the bone. this chapter presents an overview of bone cancer. the bone bone is a living tissue made up of collagen. collagen is the most abundant protein in the body. bone tissue also contains blood vessels, nerves, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. our body has about 206 bones. bones provide structure and support, protect our organs, create blood cells, store chemicals the body needs, and produce hormones. bone is light, yet strong and can regrow. bone is made up of the following: +compact bone or cortical bone-the hard, dense outer layer of bone that is covered by a membrane of strong connective tissue called the periosteum +spongey bone or cancellous bone-the spongy, porous inner layer of bone that contains red marrow +bone marrow-found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. there are 2 types of bone marrow: red and yellow. red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. yellow marrow is made mostly of fat. the skeletal system the human skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. it includes all of the bones and joints in the body. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" how bone is formed how bone is formed bone is a living tissue made of cells (osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts), calcium, phosphate, hydroxyapatite (a bone mineral), and collagen. new bone formation, known as ossification, starts in the womb and ends during adolescence, between 10 and 19 years of age. there are 2 forms of ossification: +compact bone (endochondral), which makes up most of the skeleton +cancellous bone (intermembranous), which includes parts of the skull, the shoulder blades, and the ends of the long bones. long bones are longer than they are wide. once ossification is complete, bone is continuously being replaced by a process called remodeling. remodeling breaks down and rebuilds bone and helps maintain normal calcium levels in the body. when calcium is needed, cells called osteoclasts break down bone. this releases calcium into the bloodstream. at the same time, bone-forming cells called osteoblasts create bone from calcium in the bloodstream. some types of bone cancer can interrupt this process. parts of bone: +epiphysis-the end of the bone, which is covered with cartilage to make a joint +metaphysis-located between the physis (growth plate) and diaphysis +diaphysis-the middle region of the bone +physis-the growth plate, which is made of cartilage. after skeletal maturity, this leaves a physeal scar or line visible in the bone anatomy of the bone the epiphysis is the end of the bone. the metaphysis is located between the physis (growth plate) and the diaphysis. the diaphysis is the middle region of the bone. 7 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" types of bone tumors 7 bone cancer basics \" types of bone tumors \" bone cancer types of bone tumors a bone tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within a bone. a bone tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). the cause of bone tumors is unknown. they often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly (the metaphysis). this book will discuss the following: +chondrosarcoma -starts in the cells that form cartilage. cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones to form a smooth surface that makes a joint. also, cartilage gives structure to the nose, ears, larynx, and other parts of the body. +chordoma -starts in notochordal cells that form the spine and vertebrae. chordomas are usually found in the lower spinal column (sacrum) or at the base of the skull. +ewing sarcoma -starts in the bone marrow and commonly occurs in the diaphysis of long bones or flat bones like the pelvis or scapula (shoulder blade). +giant cell tumor of bone (gctb)- is an overgrowth of cells found in the epiphysis. +osteosarcoma -starts in cells that form bone in the metaphysis near the growth plates. since bone cancer is very rare, many health care providers are not experts in diagnosing or treating these tumors. therefore, it is important to find a treatment center or hospital that has both experts and experience in your type of bone cancer. bone cancer cancers that start in the bone are called primary bone tumors. bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or kidney) are called secondary bone tumors or metastatic bone cancer. they behave very differently from primary bone tumors. sarcomas most primary bone cancers are sarcomas. sarcomas are a rare group of cancers. there are 2 main types of sarcomas: +soft tissue sarcomas +bone sarcomas soft tissue includes fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, blood and lymph vessels, and other supportive tissues of the body. soft tissue sarcomas are more common than bone sarcomas. bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form bone. osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common types of bone cancer. more information on soft tissue sarcomas can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 8 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" how bone cancer spreads 8 bone cancer basics \" how bone cancer spreads \" key points how bone cancer spreads unlike normal cells, cancer cells can grow or spread to form tumors in other parts of the body. this is called a metastasis. cancer can spread through blood or the lymphatic system. the lymphatic system contains a clear fluid called lymph. lymph gives cells water and food and contains white blood cells that fight germs. lymph nodes filter lymph and remove the germs. lymph travels throughout the body in vessels like blood does. lymph vessels and nodes are found everywhere in the body. although cancer can spread through your blood, you cannot spread your cancer to other people if they are exposed to your blood. bone cancer can spread to the lung or other bones. bone cancer that has metastasized to the lung is still called bone cancer. key points +bone cancer is a group of cancers that start in the bone or cartilage. this is called primary bone cancer. bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or kidney) are called secondary or metastatic bone tumors. +bone tumors may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). the cause of bone tumors is unknown. +bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form bone. most primary bone cancers are sarcomas. +osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common types of bone cancer. +bone cancer can metastasize to the lungs and other bones. +it is important to find a treatment center or hospital that has both experts and experience in your type of bone cancer. 9 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 20232 testing for bone cancer 10 test results 10 general health tests 12 fertility (all genders) 12 preventing pregnancy 13 performance status 13 blood tests 15 imaging tests 17 biopsy 17 genetic testing 18 biomarker tests 20 key points 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" test results 10 testing for bone cancer \" test results \" general health tests treatment planning starts with testing. accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat primary bone cancer. a biopsy is recommended before starting treatment. this chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. test results results from imaging studies and biopsies will be used to determine your treatment plan. it is important you understand what these tests mean. ask questions and keep copies of your test results. online patient portals are a great way to access your test results. keep these things in mind: +choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment. +bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. +write down questions and take notes during appointments. don't be afraid to ask your care team questions. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. +get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. +bring all images on a compact disc (cd). you can request a disc from the hospital or center where you had your imaging. x-rays, mris, and ct scans cannot be faxed. if you are meeting a new doctor, please bring all your images on a cd. +organize your papers. create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. you can do the same on your computer. +keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. add it to your phone. hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. keep your primary care physician (pcp) informed of changes to this list. you are encouraged to keep your pcp. they are great partners in your care. +include in your contact list information on the exact type of cancer, as well as any treatment and the date it started. general health tests medical history a medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. some supplements interact and affect prescriptions that your doctor may give you. tell your doctor about any symptoms you have. a medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" general health tests family history some cancers and other diseases can run in families. your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. this information is called a family history. ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. it's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations. physical exam during a physical exam, your health care provider may: +check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate +check your height and weight +listen to your lungs and heart +look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat +feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. +feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. for possible tests, see guide 1. guide 1 possible tests: those 40 years of age and over medical history and physical exam bone scan chest x-ray blood tests such as complete blood count (cbc), comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) with calcium to assess for hypercalcemia chest/abdominal/pelvic ct with contrast biopsy, as needed, performed by orthopedic oncologist at center where you will be treated * those under 40 years of age will be referred to an orthopedic oncologist bring a list of any medications, vitamins, over-the-counter drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. 12 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" fertility (all genders) 12 testing for bone cancer \" fertility (all genders) \" preventing pregnancy fertility (all genders) treatment such as chemotherapy can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. if you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. to preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't really sure at the moment. fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. more information on fertility preservation in adolescents and young adults can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. changes in fertility treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily impaired or interrupted. this temporary loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy. preventing pregnancy preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. cancer and cancer treatment can affect the ovaries and damage sperm. hormonal birth control may or may not be recommended, so ask your doctor about options such as intrauterine devices (iuds) and barrier methods. types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. those with ovaries those who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test before starting treatment. cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby if you are or become pregnant during treatment. therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy during and after treatment is recommended. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be avoided. menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your \"period\" may stop during treatment, but often returns within 2 years after treatment in those 40 years of age and under. it is still possible to become pregnant even though you might not have a period. therefore, birth control is recommended during and after treatment. consult your doctor for the best time to plan a pregnancy. those with testicles cancer and cancer treatment can damage sperm. therefore, use contraception (birth control) such as condoms to prevent pregnancy during and immediately after cancer treatment. 13 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" performance status 13 testing for bone cancer \" performance status \" blood tests performance status performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. your state of general health will be rated using a ps scale called ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group). ps is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. your preferences about treatment are always important. the ecog ps scores range from 0 to 5. +ps 0 means the person is fully active. +ps 1 means the person is still able to perform light to moderate activity, but with some limitations. +ps 2 means the person is limited to the chair or bed less than half of the time and still able to care for self. +ps 3 means the person is limited to the chair or bed more than half of the time. +ps 4 means the person is totally confined to the bed or chair and completely unable to care for self. +ps 5 means the person is not alive. good ps is usually ps 0 or ps 1. blood tests blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. they require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into your vein. some blood tests you might have are described next. alkaline phosphatase alkaline phosphatase (alp) is an enzyme found in the blood. high levels of alp levels can be a sign of bone tumors, liver disorders, or pregnancy. a bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of alp. performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" blood tests complete blood count a complete blood count (cbc) measures the levels of red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs), and platelets (plts) in your blood. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding. comprehensive metabolic panel a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) measures 14 different substances in your blood. it is usually done on the plasma part of your blood. a cmp provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. a cmp will look for higher than normal calcium levels in your blood called hypercalcemia. calcium is the most common mineral in the body. it is needed for healthy teeth, bones, and other body tissues. bone damage from cancer can cause your bones to release calcium into the bloodstream. lactate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) or lactic acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most cells. dying cells release ldh into blood. fast-growing cells, such as tumor cells, also release ldh. pregnancy test those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins. those with bone cancer should be treated at centers experienced in this type of cancer. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" imaging tests imaging tests imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. a radiologist, who is an expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. your doctor will discuss the results with you. you will not have all of the following tests. x-ray an x-ray is a type of radiation. in small doses, it is used to make pictures of the inside of the body. it might be referred to as a radiograph. bone scan a bone scan uses a radiotracer. a radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. it can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. however, the test is quick and painless. a special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health problems. ct scan a computed tomography (ct or cat) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. it takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. all the images are combined to make one detailed picture. intravenous (iv) contrast is often used. ct machine a ct machine is large and has a tunnel in the middle. during the test, you will lie on the table that moves slowly through the tunnel. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" imaging tests contrast contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body. contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. it is used to make the pictures clearer. the contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine immediately after the test. the types of contrast vary and are different for ct and mri. tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past, especially to iodine or to shellfish such as shrimp. this is important. you might be given medicines, such as benadryl and prednisone, to avoid the effects of those allergies. contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well. mammogram a mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. the pictures are made using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. diagnostic mammograms are made with more x-rays than screening mammograms. a bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. it is used to identify any tumors, and if so, the number and size of the tumor(s). a mammogram might be needed to confirm that the cancer found in your bones is not from breast cancer. mri scan a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. it does not use x-rays. during the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. contrast might be used. a closed mri has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. an open mri has a magnet top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. most people prefer to find a location with an open mri. tell your doctor if you have any metal in your body or if you tend to have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces). you might be surprised how tight a fit it is and how confined you might feel even in an open mri. pet/ct scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. a tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow. cancer cells show up as bright spots on pet scans. however, not all tumors will appear on a pet scan. also, not all bright spots are cancer. it is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on pet. inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. when a pet scan is combined with ct, it is called a pet/ct scan. it may be done with one or two machines depending on the cancer center. a whole-body pet/ct or head-to-toe scan can be used to look for evidence of cancer throughout your body. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biopsy 17 testing for bone cancer \" biopsy \" genetic testing biopsy a biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue for testing. a diagnosis of bone cancer is confirmed using a core needle or surgical biopsy. the placement of the biopsy is critical. therefore, it is recommended that the biopsy be performed at an experienced center where you will receive treatment. +core needle biopsy removes tissue samples with a large, hollow needle that can grab a piece of tissue. this is frequently performed under light sedation by an interventional radiologist. it can also be performed by your surgeon in the office. +surgical biopsy removes a sample of the tumor through a small incision. a surgical biopsy should be performed by your treating surgeon. this requires a trip to the operating room. bone marrow tests bone marrow tests might be done in certain cases. there are 2 types of bone marrow tests that are often done at the same time: +bone marrow aspirate +bone marrow biopsy your bone marrow is like a sponge holding liquid and cells. an aspirate takes some of the liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy takes a piece of the sponge. the samples are usually taken from the back of the hip bone (pelvis). you will likely lie on your belly or side. your doctors will first clean and give sedation and/or numb your skin and outer surface of your bone. for an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed through your skin and into the bone. liquid bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe. for the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to remove a core sample. you may feel bone pain at your hip for a few days. your skin may bruise. genetic testing genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup). the goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological parents called germline mutations. some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. you can pass these genes on to your children. also, family members might carry these mutations. tell your doctor if there is a family history of cancer. there are 3 major types of genetic testing: +cytogenetic -to examine whole chromosomes +biochemical-to measure proteins produced by genes +molecular-to look for dna or gene mutations and/or gene fusions while it can be confusing, just know that testing done to look for an inherited gene mutation or an inherited risk of cancer is different than genetic testing done on cancer cells or testing to look for proteins produced by cancer cells. 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests 18 testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests \" biomarker tests biomarker tests inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) molecules. these molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome. chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell. normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. each chromosome contains thousands of genes. genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make. a mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code. a sample from your biopsy will undergo lab tests to look for specific dna mutations/ alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features. this information is used to learn more about your cancer and to choose the best treatment for you. it is sometimes called molecular testing, tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). it identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. proteins are written like this: idh1. genes are written with italics like this: idh1. when a gene or protein is found, it is shown with a plus sign (+) like this: idh1+. when a gene or protein has not been found, it is written with a negative sign (-) like this: idh1-. ewing sarcoma a cell must make a copy of its chromosomes before dividing into two cells. sometimes, there are mistakes in the copies. one type of mistake is when parts (dna) of two chromosomes break off and switch with each other. this is called a translocation. it can result in a fusion of two genes. a translocation between chromosome 11 and 22 is written as t(11;22) and is common in ewing sarcoma. ewing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion of the ews gene (ewsr1) on chromosome 22 with various members of the ets gene family (fli1, erg, etv1, etv4, and fev), with fli1 being the most common. almost everyone with ewing sarcoma will have one of the possible gene fusions. this is not inherited from your parents, but happens for some other reason. when this occurs only in cancer cells, this is called a somatic mutation or somatic change. msi-h/d mmr mutation microsatellites are short, repeated strings of dna. when errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (mmr) proteins. some cancers have dna mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. this is called microsatellite instability (msi) or deficient mismatch repair (d mmr). when cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called msi-h (microsatellite instability-high). this is often due to d mmr genes. pembrolizumab (keytruda) is an option for those with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests tumor mutational burden when there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor dna, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (tmb-h). pembrolizumab (keytruda), nivolumab (opdivo), or ipilimumab (yervoy) might be used in some cases for tmb-h tumors. tumor mutation testing a sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific mutations. in tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. idh1 mutation some mutations such as idh1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) gene mutations can be targeted with specific therapies. ivosidenib (tibsovo) is for those with chondrosarcoma who are susceptible to idh1 mutations. next-generation sequencing next-generation sequencing (ngs) is a high-throughput method used to determine the dna sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in your bone tumor. pcr a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a lab process that can make millions or billions of copies of your dna (genetic information). pcr is very sensitive. it can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. these copies are called pcr product. what is your family health history? some cancers and other diseases run in families --those who are related to you through genes passed down from parent to child. this information is called a family health history. you can ask family members about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. for relatives who have died, ask about the cause and age of death. start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. some of the questions to ask include: 3do you have any chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, or health conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol? 3have you had any other diseases, such as cancer or stroke? 3how old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? 3what is our family's ancestry--from what countries did our ancestors originate? 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone

a general overview of cancer staging. overview there are many staging systems. most staging systems include information about: +where the tumor is located in the body +the cell type (such as sarcoma or carcinoma) +the size of the tumor +whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes +whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body +tumor grade, which refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look and how likely the tumor is to grow and spread tnm score the tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage most bone cancers. in this system, the letters t, n, and m describe different areas of cancer growth. based on imaging and biopsy results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. the higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. these scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. a tnm example might look like this: t1n0m0 or t1, n0, m0. this might represent a stage 1 cancer. +t (tumor)-size and depth of the main (primary) tumor +n (node) -if cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes +m (metastasis) -if cancer has spread (metastasized) to distant parts of the body t = tumor the primary tumor size is measured in centimeters (cm). a large pea is 1 cm. a golf ball is 4 cm. a baseball is 7 cm. a grapefruit is 15 cm. tumors are staged based on location. 23 nccn

tnm score n = node there are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout your body. they work as filters to help fight infection and remove harmful things from your body. regional lymph nodes are those located near the tumor. cancer in the lymph nodes is called nodal disease and is rare in bone cancer. +nx-cancer in nearby lymph nodes cannot be measured. +n0-there is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes. +n1-cancer is found in the regional lymph nodes m = metastasis cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body is shown as m1. when cancer is not metastatic it is shown as m0. common sites for metastasis include the lung and bone. +m0-no distant metastasis +m1-distant metastasis is found m1a -metastasis is in the lung m1b -metastasis is in the bone or other distant sites grade another factor used in staging is the cancer grade. grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope (histology). higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread faster than lower-grade cancers. gx means the grade can't be determined, followed by g1, g2, and g3. well differentiated (g1) means the cancer cells look like normal cells. poorly differentiated (g3) means the cancer cells

care team 30 surgery 32 systemic therapy 33 radiation therapy 34 clinical trials 36 other treatments 37 key points 29 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" care team treatment for bone cancer is based on the type, size, and location of the tumor. this chapter presents an overview of the types of treatment and what to expect. not everyone will receive the same treatment. care team treating bone cancer takes a team approach. treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (mdt). an mdt is a team of doctors, health care workers, and social care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience with your type of cancer. this team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. ask who will coordinate your care. some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. the mdt should meet on a regular basis and should include the following: +an orthopedic oncologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors. they treat any area of the body except the neck and skull and inside the chest and abdomen. +a medical or pediatric oncologist treats cancer using systemic (drug) therapy. +a radiation oncologist prescribes and plans radiation therapy to treat cancer. +a musculoskeletal radiologist interprets the results of x-rays and other imaging tests. +a bone pathologist interprets the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy or surgery. depending on your type of care, the team might include: +a thoracic surgeon who performs operations within the chest. +a plastic surgeon who performs operations to improve function or reconstruct missing areas. +an interventional radiologist who performs needle biopsies, ablation therapies, and embolizations, and places ports for treatment. +a physiatrist, a medical doctor who specializes in physical movement and rehabilitation. +a vascular surgeon who specializes in procedures involving arteries, veins, and lymph circulation. +a surgical oncologist or general surgeon who has specialized knowledge and experience related to the diagnosis, preoperative, operative, and postoperative care for the whole patient. +a neurosurgeon who specializes in surgery on the nervous system, especially the brain and spinal cord. 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" surgery +an orthopedic oncologist or orthopedic surgeon who focuses on the body's musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and nerves. +an orthopedic spine surgeon who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases and conditions. may be an orthopedic oncologist. your physical, mental, and emotional well-being are important. you know yourself better than anyone. help other team members understand: +how you feel +what you need +what is working and what is not keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. this will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know who to contact with questions or concerns. surgery surgery is an operation or procedure to remove cancer from the body. the type of surgery depends on size, location, and number of tumor(s). surgery can be used to: +remove all of the tumor +relieve pain or discomfort the goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer. to full remove all of the cancer, your surgeon must cut out the tumor with a rim of normal tissue around the edge. this allows the pathologist to determine a surgical margin. a clear or negative margin resection (r0) is when no cancerous cells are found in the tissue around the edge of the tumor. an r1 positive margin or r1 resection indicates the surgeon has removed all of the visible tumor, but the microscopic margins are still positive for tumor cells. in an r2 positive margin, the surgeon does not or is unable to remove all of the visible tumor. a tumor that can be removed completely with surgery is called resectable. not all tumors are resectable. you might receive treatment to shrink a tumor or the amount of cancer before surgery. this is called preoperative or neoadjuvant treatment. treatment after surgery might be referred to as postoperative or adjuvant. when preparing for surgery, seek care or ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of bone cancer. it is important to find an experienced surgeon who has performed this type of procedure many times with good results. limb-sparing resection for bone cancer in the limbs, the goal of surgery, whenever possible, is to preserve or maintain limb function. this is called limb-sparing surgery. a surgeon who is an expert in your type of bone cancer should be consulted before deciding upon surgical treatment options. rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy, will likely be part of a limb-sparing treatment plan. this may include occupational therapy to help with daily life skills or physical therapy to help your body move and function. a physiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in rehabilitation. 31 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" surgery amputation amputation is the removal of a limb or other body part. a surgeon who is an expert in your type of bone cancer should be consulted before amputation. one type of amputation is a rotationplasty. in a rotationplasty, the bottom of the femur, the knee, and the top of the tibia are removed. the lower leg is then rotated and attached to the femur. the intention of this surgery is to allow knee function when it otherwise would not be possible. rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy, will be part of any amputation. seek a peer support group to connect with others who have experienced the loss of a limb. this will aid in your recovery and help you to maintain an active lifestyle. a physiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in rehabilitation. palliative surgery surgery to ease pain or discomfort is called palliative surgery. it might be used to remove metastases that are causing pain. surgery to remove a metastasis is called a metastasectomy. this is different from a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. palliative surgery is sometimes offered to fix a broken bone or help prevent a cancerous bone from breaking. order of treatments most people with cancer will receive more than one type of treatment. below is an overview of the order of treatments. 3preoperative or neoadjuvant (before) therapy is given to shrink the tumor before a primary treatment such as surgery. 3perioperative therapy is systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, given before and after surgery. 3primary treatment is the main treatment given to rid the body of cancer. 3postoperative or adjuvant (after) therapy is given after primary treatment to rid the body of any cancer cells left behind from surgery. it is also used when the risk of cancer returning (recurrence) is felt to be high. 3definitive treatment is the best treatment after all choices have been considered. 3first-line therapy is the first set of systemic (drug) treatment given. 3second-line therapy is the next set of treatment given if cancer progresses during or after systemic therapy. talk to your care team about your treatment plan and what it means for your stage and type of cancer. 32 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" systemic therapy systemic therapy systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. each works differently. types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. systemic therapy might be used alone or with other therapies. goals of systemic therapy should be discussed before starting treatment. the choice of therapy takes into consideration many factors, including age, other serious health issues, and future treatment possibilities. your preferences about treatment are important. if you have any religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds of treatment, now would be the time to share them with your care team. warnings! you might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain food or herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. some supplements and food can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. this is called a drug interaction. it is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. some examples include: +turmeric +gingko biloba +green tea extract +st. john's wort certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. antacids, heart medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy. this is why it is important to tell your doctor about any medications, vitamins, over-the-counter (otc) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. bring a list with you to every visit. chemotherapy chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and normal cells. more than one chemotherapy drug may be used to treat your type of cancer. when only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. a combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs. some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein or injected under the skin with a needle. other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed. the final dose differs between people because it is based on body weight and height. intrathecal chemotherapy is injected into spinal or brain fluid. in most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows the body to recover before the next cycle. cycles vary in length depending on which chemotherapy is used. you will have tests to see how well treatment is working. you might spend time in the hospital during treatment. targeted therapy targeted therapy is drug therapy that focuses on specific or unique features of cancer cells. targeted therapies seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the body. these drugs stop the action of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/or survive. some targeted therapy drugs block the chemical signals that tell cancer cells to grow. other targeted therapy drugs block signals that cause new blood vessels to form. others target hormones. 33 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" radiation therapy immunotherapy immunotherapy is drug therapy that increases the activity of your immune system. by doing so, it improves your body's ability to find and destroy cancer cells. immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. radiation therapy radiation therapy (rt) uses high-energy radiation from photons, electrons, or protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. it is given over a certain period of time. radiation therapy can be given alone or with certain systemic therapies. when used as supportive care to help ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer, it is called palliative rt. radiation may be given: +as the primary (first) treatment +before surgery, called neoadjuvant rt, to shrink the tumor before surgery +after surgery, called adjuvant rt, to kill any cancerous cells that remain +as palliative treatment to ease pain or discomfort caused by bone tumors external beam radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy (ebrt) uses a machine outside of the body to aim radiation at the tumor(s). there is more than one type of ebrt used in the treatment of bone cancer. these allow for safer, higher doses of radiation. types of ebrt that may be used to treat your cancer include: +stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) uses high-energy radiation beams to treat cancers in 5 or fewer treatments. +stereotactic radiosurgery (srs) uses special equipment to position the body and give one precise, large dose of radiation. +three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3d-crt) uses computer software and ct images to aim beams that match the shape of the tumor. +intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt) uses small beams of different strengths to match the shape of the tumor. +particle beam radiation therapy uses protons, carbon ions, or other heavy ions to treat bone cancer. internal radiation internal radiation called brachytherapy is placed inside the body as a solid implant similar to beads or seeds. radiopharmaceuticals radiopharmaceuticals contain a radioactive substance that emits radiation. this radioactive substance is different than contrast material used in imaging. samarium 153-edtmp or sm153-edtmp (quadramet) is a beta-particle-emitting, bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical. it is injected into a vein and distributed throughout the body, where it is absorbed in areas where cancer has invaded the bone. 34 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" clinical trials clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase i trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. they also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful. +phase ii trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase iii trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase iv trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. take time to discuss with family, friends, or others whom you trust. keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. start the conversation don't wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. if you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the requirements. if you have already started standard treatment you may not be eligible for certain clinical trials. try not to be discouraged if you cannot join. new clinical trials are always becoming available. 35 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" clinical trials frequently asked questions there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. are clinical trials free? there is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. the study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. you may, however, have costs indirectly related to the trial, such as the cost of transportation or child care due to extra appointments. during the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. this care is billed to--and often covered by-- insurance. you are responsible for copays and any costs for this care that are not covered by your insurance. finding a clinical trial in the united states nccn cancer centers nccn. org/cancercenters the national cancer

ablation ablation uses extreme cold or extreme heat to destroy cancer cells. it can destroy small tumors with little harm to nearby tissue. there are 2 types of thermal ablation used to destroy cancer cells: +cryotherapy or cryosurgery +radiofrequency ablation (rfa) both types of ablation use a special needle, called a probe, which is inserted into the tumor. with cryotherapy, a medical gas is passed through the probe to cause below-freezing temperatures. this freezes the tumor to destroy it. with rfa, the probe emits radio waves to heat the tumor and destroy it. the probe can be guided into place with a ct scan, ultrasound, or other imaging tests. the probe will be removed when treatment is done. embolization embolization treats tumors by cutting off their blood supply. a catheter will be inserted into an artery and guided to the tumor. once in place, beads will be inserted to block the blood flow. with chemoembolization, the beads are coated with chemotherapy. radioembolization uses small radioactive beads. supportive care supportive care is health care that relieves symptoms caused by cancer or its treatment and improves quality of life. it might include pain relief (palliative care), emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or family counseling. supportive care is given during all cancer stages. tell your care team how you are feeling and about any side effects. best supportive care is used with other treatments to improve quality of life. best supportive care, supportive care, and palliative care are often used interchangeably. it is important to tell your care team about all side effects so they can be managed. 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" key points key points +treatment

radiation therapy might be done in some cases. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview chondrosarcoma starts in the cells that form cartilage. it is most commonly found in the thigh bone (femur), arm (humerus), or pelvis. treatment is based on the grade of the tumor and if it can be removed with surgery. a tumor that can be removed with surgery is called resectable. an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. surgery to remove all of the tumor is called wide excision. treatment is grouped as follows: +low grade and intracompartmental (intracompartmental tumor has not grown outside of the bone) +high grade (grade 2 or 3), clear cell, or extracompartmental (tumor has grown outside of the bone) +metastatic disease at initial diagnosis +dedifferentiated-treated with ewing sarcoma therapy +mesenchymal-treated with ewing sarcoma therapy treatment treatment options will be based on your wishes and your care team's recommendations. low-grade and intracompartmental chondrosarcoma a low-grade (grade 1) and intracompartmental tumor is still within the bone. it has not grown through the bone wall or spread to any other part of the body. these tumors are sometimes called atypical cartilaginous tumors. depending on the location of the tumor, treatment is intralesional excision (surgery) to remove part of the tumor. this is also called curettage. intralesional excision is not an option for pelvic tumors. after treatment you will be monitored with the following tests for the return of cancer called recurrence. +physical exam +x-rays of primary site and/or mri or ct (both with contrast) as needed every 6 to 12 months for 2 years, then yearly as needed +chest imaging every 6 to 12 months for 2

recurrence cancer that has returned after a disease-free period is called recurrence. if cancer returns at or near the same place, then the treatment options are: +if resectable, surgery to remove all of the tumor (wide excision). if surgery does not remove all of the cancer, then you might have more surgery or radiation therapy. +if unresectable, radiation therapy might be given. metastatic disease treatment for metastatic chondrosarcoma is based on if there are a few metastases called oligometastases or if the cancer is widespread. treatment focuses on reducing the number of metastases or amount of cancer. oligometastases in oligometastases, there are a limited number of metastases. if possible, you will have surgery to remove all of the metastases. radiation therapy is an option for unresectable metastases. a clinical trial is also an option. 41 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023chondrosarcoma \" key points widespread disease treatment options for

chordoma \" overview \" treatment chordoma is a slow-growing sarcoma that usually starts in the lower spinal column or at the base of the skull. it often grows into the soft tissue around the bone making it difficult to treat. treatment options include surgery or radiation therapy. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview chordomas are a type of cancerous tumor that can occur anywhere along the spine, from the base of the skull to the tailbone. these tumors grow slowly, gradually invading nearby bone and soft tissue. tumors often involve critical structures such as the brainstem, spinal cord, and important nerves and arteries. for this reason, chordomas are difficult to treat. they can also come back, or recur, after treatment--usually in the same place as the first tumor. this is called a local recurrence. in about 2 out of 5 people, the tumor eventually spreads, or metastasizes, to other parts of the body. this chapter is for conventional or chondroid chordomas. those with chordoma should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team who are experts in the management of chordoma. before starting treatment, you will have imaging tests of the main (primary) sarcoma site. for those with poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated chordoma, see information on soft tissue sarcomas at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. treatment chordomas are treated based on the location of the tumor: +tumors in the spine that include the sacrum and coccyx +tumors at or in the base of the skull a tumor that can be removed with surgery is called resectable. an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery and might be treated with radiation therapy (rt). chordomas often grown outside the bone into surrounding tissue near vital organs, veins, and arteries. parts of these tissues might also need to be removed and sewn back together. this is called

group of cancers that start in the bone or soft tissue. treatment begins with chemotherapy. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview ewing sarcoma is a cancerous tumor that occurs in bone or soft tissue. soft tissue includes muscle, organs, or nerves. there are 2 types of ewing sarcoma: +ewing sarcoma of bone +ewing sarcoma of soft tissues ewing sarcoma of bone usually occurs in the thigh (femur), pelvis, and bones of the chest. however, any bone may be affected. when arising in a long bone, the diaphysis is the most common site. ewing sarcoma can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), usually to the lungs, to other bones, or to the bone marrow. testing before starting treatment, you will have imaging, blood, and other tests. treatment can alter fertility. therefore, you might be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss fertility preservation options before starting treatment. for possible tests, see guide 5.

unpredictable disease that tends to return. treatment is needed to prevent severe bone damage. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview giant cell tumor of bone (gctb) is a rare, aggressive, non-cancerous tumor. it generally happens in adults between 20 and 40 years of age, when skeletal bone growth is complete. when viewed under a microscope, the tumor consists of many very large cells or \"giant\" cells. it is not known what causes a giant cell tumor. gctb usually develops near a joint at the end of the bone. the knee is the most common location, but it can be found in the bones of the arms and the legs. it can also affect the flat bones, such as the breastbone or pelvis. gctb has a strong tendency to return to the same location. this is called local recurrence. it may also appear in the lungs (metastasize). when possible, treatment for a giant cell tumor almost always involves surgery to remove the tumor. treatment aims to prevent damage to the bone near the affected joint. before starting treatment, you will have a biopsy to confirm diagnosis and imaging tests to see if the cancer is in one area (localized) or has spread to distant sites (metastasized). giant cell tumor of bone giant cell tumors are often found at the end of the thigh bone (femur). 55 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer,

the location of the tumor or if you have other more serious health issues, surgery might not be possible. if this is the case, see unresectable treatment options. resectable a resectable tumor can be removed with surgery. when possible, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. frequently, first-line surgery involves an intralesional excision or curettage to save normal bone and scrape out all tumor cells. sometimes, a bigger surgery (wide resection) is required to remove all bone containing the tumor. this wide resection type of surgery can require reconstruction of the bone or joint. at the time of surgery, your surgeon might use treatment like ablation or embolization to help prevent the return of the tumor. unresectable an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. it might include those with a resectable tumor, but who have other more serious health conditions that prevent surgery. treatments include: +denosumab (preferred) and/or +embolization (preferred) and/or +radiation therapy (rt) there are some risks with rt and long-term use of denosumab. you should see a dentist before starting denosumab. discuss with your care team which treatment is right for you. after treatment you will have imaging tests, such as x-rays, ct, and mri. if tests find that the tumor is now resectable, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. metastatic disease in metastatic disease, there is more than one tumor. while gctb is usually benign, it can metastasize to the lungs or other bone. for resectable tumors, you might have surgery to remove the main tumor and metastasis. for unresectable tumors, options include: +denosumab +radiation therapy +observation you should see a dentist before starting denosumab. observation is sometimes referred to as

high-grade osteosarcoma this section is for high-grade osteosarcoma. other types of high-grade non-osteosarcoma such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (ups) of bone could also be treated the same way. treatment involves chemotherapy, then surgery, followed by more chemotherapy. systemic therapy before surgery for most, treatment starts with preoperative chemotherapy. the goal of chemotherapy is to kill the cancer cells before surgery. after chemotherapy, you will have an imaging test to restage your cancer, assess treatment response, and plan surgery. surgery or local control therapy most osteosarcomas are treated with surgery to remove all of the cancer cells in your body. mri and ct scans helps determine if the osteosarcoma can be removed with surgery. most osteosarcomas are resectable with limb-sparing surgery. this means the surgeon removes the bone containing cancer and reconstructs the limb. some osteosarcomas require amputation. rarely, the tumor is unresectable. in this case, treatment then involves radiation therapy or ablation. systemic therapy after surgery treatment after surgery is called adjuvant treatment. when no cancer is found in the surgical margin, it is called a negative margin. treatment is chemotherapy. when cancer remains in the surgical margin, it is called a positive margin. treatment might be chemotherapy, or more surgery. radiation therapy might follow surgery. metastatic disease at diagnosis this section is for those with metastatic disease at diagnosis. metastases can be found in the lungs (pulmonary), bone (skeletal), or internal organs (visceral). these are often resectable. surgery to remove a metastasis is called a metastasectomy. this is different from a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. some metastases might be treated with systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or other therapies. for example, unresectable lung metastases might be treated with ablation. if surgery is not

cancer, 2024colon cancer basics \" the colon colon cancer is common and treatable. many cancers that start in the colon can be cured, especially when found early. the colon the colon makes up most of the large intestine (bowel). in the colon water is absorbed from eaten food, turning it into feces or stool. after leaving the colon, stool moves into the rectum. the rectum is the last 6 inches or so of the large bowel. stool is held here until it leaves the body through an opening called the anus. the term colorectal cancer is used to describe cancers that form in either the colon or rectum. while these cancers are similar, their treatment is different. the focus of this guide is colon cancer. for information on rectal cancer treatment, see the nccn guidelines for patients: rectal cancer at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. the colon the start of the colon is a pouch called the cecum. sticking out from the cecum is the appendix. this skinny tube is about the size of a finger and is closed at one end. the rest of the colon has 4 main sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024colon cancer basics \" polyps 6 colon cancer basics \" polyps \" key points polyps polyps are non-cancerous growths that form on the inner lining of the colon and rectum. the most common type is called an adenoma. while it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive colon cancer. cancer that forms in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma. this is the most common type of colon cancer. polyps that rarely turn into cancer include hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps. while most polyps do not become cancer, almost all colon cancers start in a polyp. removing polyps can prevent cancer before it starts. most can be removed during a colonoscopy using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy. polyps can also be tested to make sure that cancer has not already started to develop. for more information, see the nccn guidelines for patients: colorectal cancer screening at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. key points this guide discusses the following key topics about colon cancer diagnosis and treatment. testing and treatment planning +testing the tumor for a biomarker (feature) called mismatch repair deficiency (d mmr) +treatment planning based on mismatch repair status and results of other testing non-metastatic cancer +treatment for polyps with cancer +colectomy (surgery) for

key points 8 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" mismatch repair testing 8 testing and treatment planning \" mismatch repair testing \" family health history this chapter describes testing and other care needed to create your treatment plan. all colon cancers should be tested for mutations (changes) in genes that fix damaged dna, called mismatch repair (mmr) genes. most colon cancers are found during colonoscopy. it is common to have another colonoscopy to thoroughly examine the colon and look for other possible areas of cancer. this is called a diagnostic colonoscopy. mismatch repair testing mismatch repair (mmr) or microsatellite instability (msi) testing is recommended for everyone diagnosed with colon cancer. this feature of some colon cancers is a type of biomarker. biomarkers are targetable changes of a cancer that help guide your treatment. testing involves analyzing a piece of the colon tumor in a lab. depending on the method used, an abnormal result is called either microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) or mismatch repair deficient (d mmr). tumors that do not have these changes are referred to as microsatellite stable (mss) or mismatch repair proficient (p mmr). if the cancer is d mmr/msi-h, you will also be tested for an inherited condition called lynch syndrome, described next. family health history your doctor will ask about the health history of your biological (related by blood) family members. those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer are more likely to have this cancer compared to the average person. most colon cancers occur for unknown reasons. while rare, some people are born with a disorder that makes them more likely to get colon and other cancers. these are called inherited cancer syndromes. two such conditions include lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (fap). people born with lynch syndrome are at high risk of developing colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. lynch syndrome is caused by inherited mutations of the mmr genes. for cancers found to have the d mmr/msi-h biomarker, testing for lynch syndrome is recommended. fap causes hundreds to thousands of polyps to form in the colon and rectum. the polyps start as benign growths, but over time can become invasive colon cancer. cancer often develops by age 50 in people with classic fap. a milder form (attenuated fap) causes fewer polyps and usually starts later in life. if an inherited syndrome is suspected, your doctor will refer you to a genetic counselor. this expert can speak with you and your family about testing for syndromes related to colon cancer. to be tested, you must provide a sample of blood or saliva. a pathologist tests the sample for gene mutations that cause these syndromes. it is important to meet with a genetic counselor before having any genetic testing. 9 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" blood tests blood tests the following tests are not used alone to diagnose colon cancer, but abnormal results may signal health problems. complete blood count cancer and other health problems can cause low or high blood cell counts. a complete blood count (cbc) measures the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in a blood sample. white blood cells help the body to fight infection. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. platelets help wounds heal by forming blood clots. chemistry profile also known as a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp), this group of tests provides information about how well your kidneys, liver, and other organs are working. cea blood test carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) is a protein found in blood. the level of cea is often higher than normal in people with colon cancer, especially if the cancer has spread to other organs. monitoring cea can be helpful even when the cancer is only in the colon and the level is normal, because the level will rise if the cancer later spreads to other organs. however, monitoring cea is not helpful for everyone, even if the cancer has spread. people who are pregnant and those who smoke may have higher cea levels. ct dna there is growing interest in circulating tumor dna (ct dna) testing for people with early-stage colon cancer. also called a liquid biopsy, this test looks for small pieces of dna released by tumor cells into the blood. it can detect microscopic disease that may remain in the body after colectomy. this information may be helpful in predicting the risk of the cancer returning or other outcomes. but more information is needed, and at this time ct dna testing is only recommended as part of a clinical trial. i was diagnosed in the er at age 44, 58 days after my wedding, and i faced biases and unexpected challenges. i had to fight to get care because i was dismissed for more than a year for so many different reasons. my journey taught me this: never give up, explore every reasonable option, and prioritize your mental health. your life is the only one you have, so be true to yourself. before any diagnosis, put on your life jacket first--take care of yourself. get screened, know your family history. when facing colorectal cancer, the best care begins with self-care. \"\" 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" imaging imaging imaging tests can show areas of cancer inside the body. a radiologist interprets the images and conveys the results to your oncologist. your care team will tell you how to prepare for your scans. if you get nervous in tight spaces, let them know. you may be offered a type of medicine called a sedative to help you relax. ct computed tomography (ct) is the main imaging test used to see colon cancer in the body. during the scan you will lie face-up on a table that moves through a tunnel-like machine. you will be able to hear and speak with a technician at all times. a substance called contrast is used to make the pictures clearer. it is injected into your vein and mixed with a liquid to drink. you may feel flushed or get hives. some people have an allergic reaction. tell your doctor if you've had problems with contrast in the past. mri magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is not often used to plan treatment for colon cancer. your doctor may order an mri to get a better look at the liver or rectum, or if the ct scan results are unclear. getting an mri is much like getting a ct scan. in some cases, the area of the body being imaged is placed within a narrowed coil device that looks like a brace. it covers your body from below your chest to the top of your legs. it sends and receives radio waves. straps may be used to help you stay in place. an mri may cause your body to feel warm. if mri is being used to better see cancer near the rectum, an enema may be needed. or a gel may be inserted into the rectum beforehand. ct scan ct with contrast is the main imaging test used to determine the extent of colon cancer in the body. ct takes many pictures of the inside of the body using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make one detailed picture. 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" fertility and family planning fertility and family planning for unknown reasons, colon cancer is being diagnosed more often in young adults. some cancer treatments make it hard or impossible to have children. if you are interested in potentially having children in the future, tell your care team. they will discuss any fertility-related risks of your treatment plan with you. some methods for preserving (keeping) fertility before cancer treatment are described below. your doctor may refer you for counseling about fertility preservation options. sperm banking sperm banking stores semen for later use by freezing it in liquid nitrogen. the medical term for this is semen cryopreservation. egg freezing unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and stored for later use. this is called egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation. ovarian tissue banking this method involves removing part or all of an ovary and freezing the part that contains the eggs. the frozen tissue that contains the eggs can later be unfrozen and put back in the body. for more information on fertility and family planning, see the nccn guidelines for patients for adolescent and young adult cancer at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 12 nccn guidelines for

20 surveillance 21 key points 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" polyps with cancer colon cancer often forms in polyps on the lining of the colon, but can also form as lesions. this chapter explains treatment for cancer that has not spread to areas far from the colon. polyps with cancer a polyp is an overgrowth of cells on the inner lining of the colon wall. the most common type is called an adenoma. while it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive colon cancer. cancer that starts in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma. there are 2 main shapes of polyps. pedunculated polyps are shaped like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall. they have a stalk and round top. sessile polyps are flatter and do not have a stalk. a polyp in which cancer has just started to grow is called a malignant (cancerous) polyp. most polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy, using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy. colon polyps polyps are growths on the inner lining of the bowel wall. some look like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall. these are called pedunculated polyps. others are flatter and do not have a stalk. these are called sessile polyps. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer often, no further treatment is needed after a polypectomy. in other cases, surgery (resection) of a bigger piece of the colon is needed. this depends on: +the size and shape of the polyp (pedunculated or sessile), +the polypectomy results, and +the results of testing the removed tissue. before deciding whether resection is needed after a polypectomy, your doctor will review the results of testing with you and discuss your options. invasive cancer for cancers not found early enough to be removed by polypectomy, colectomy (colon surgery) is needed. surgery is only an option if the colon tumor can be completely removed. if you cannot have surgery first, see page 19. colectomy a colectomy is a surgery that removes the part of the colon with cancer. after the cancerous part is removed, the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are sewn or stapled together. at least 12 lymph nodes near the tumor will be removed and tested for cancer, in addition to any nodes that look abnormal to the surgeon. a colectomy can be done in two ways. the open method removes tumor tissue through a colectomy surgery for colon cancer is called colectomy. it involves removing the cancerous part of the colon. the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are then attached to each other. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer large cut in your abdomen. the minimally invasive method involves making a few small cuts. tools are inserted through the cuts to see and remove part of your colon. the tissue removed during surgery is sent to a pathologist. the pathologist determines how far the cancer has grown within the colon wall. they also test the removed lymph nodes for cancer. these results are used to assign the cancer a stage. the stage helps determine whether you need chemotherapy after surgery. at the time of colectomy, some people may also have a procedure called a colostomy. this is done in cases where it may not be safe to reconnect the remaining sections of colon. in a colostomy, the remaining upper part of the colon is attached to an opening on the surface of the abdomen. this opening is called a stoma. stool exits the body through the stoma and enters a bag attached to the skin. this is typically only needed for a short time. for colon cancer surgery, the colostomy can often be reversed with another operation. colostomy is also known as diversion because it diverts (redirects) the flow of stool. colostomy if the two healthy ends of the remaining colon cannot be safely reconnected after the cancer is removed, a colostomy may be performed. a colostomy connects a part of the colon to the outside of the abdomen. this creates an opening in your abdomen that allows stool to pass through. for colon cancer surgery, it is rare for a colostomy not to be reversed with another operation. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer bowel blockage in rare cases, a tumor may grow so large that it blocks the flow of stool. there are several ways to deal with a blockage. one option is a colectomy that also unblocks the bowel. this is known as a one-stage colectomy. a second option is colectomy with colostomy. this is typically only needed for a short time. another possibility is that a colostomy may be done first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer. lastly, in rare cases, a mesh metal tube called a stent may be placed first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer. the stent keeps the colon open, allowing gas and stool to pass. staging the cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body. having a general idea of the structure of the colon wall is helpful for understanding how colon cancer is staged. the colon wall is made of layers of tissue. cancer starts in the innermost layer that comes in contact with food. this layer is called the mucosa. the next layer is the submucosa. it is made of connective tissue and contains mucus glands, blood and lymph vessels, and nerves. the submucosa is followed by a layer of muscle called the muscularis propria. the outer, fourth layer is called serosa (or adventitia). if left untreated, cancer cells grow through the layers of the colon wall, towards the inside of the abdomen. the cancer can then invade structures or organs outside of the colon. cancer cells can also break off from the colon tumor and travel through lymph or blood to nearby lymph nodes. the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage colon cancer. in the ajcc system, the following key pieces of information about the cancer are used to give it a stage:your care team will give you information on: how to prepare for surgery what to expect during and after surgery recovery possible short-and long-term side effects of colectomy, including: !leaking from the spot where the colon was reconnected (anastomotic leak) !changes in bowel habits !bowel blocked by scar tissue !organs pushing through tissues or muscles weakened by surgery (hernia) 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer +t: how far the tumor has grown into or through the colon wall +n: whether any lymph nodes have cancer +m: whether the cancer has spread to areas or organs outside the colon (metastasized) the t, n, and m scores are combined to assign the cancer one of the following stages: 0, i (1), ii (2), iii (3), or iv (4). the stages are explained below. stage 0 there are abnormal cells on the innermost layer of the colon wall. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into deeper layers of the colon wall. stage 0 colon cancer is also called carcinoma in situ of the colon. stage 1 the cancer has grown into either the second or third layer of the colon wall. there is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon. stage 2 the cancer has grown into, or beyond, the fourth layer of the colon wall. there is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon. stage 3 the cancer has spread from the colon to nearby lymph nodes or there are tumor deposits. tumor deposits are small tumors in the fat around the colon. stage 4 the cancer has spread to areas outside the colon and nearby lymph nodes. colon cancer spreads most often to the liver and/or lungs. if you can't have surgery first having surgery first is not always an option. it may not be possible because of the location of the tumor, or because of other health problems. in this case, systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) is given first. systemic therapy may also be given first for advanced cancers, or cancer that has spread to lymph nodes. if this approach is planned, chemotherapy is recommended for p mmr/mss cancers. immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor is preferred for d mmr/msi-h cancers. immunotherapy increases the activity of your immune system, improving your body's ability to find and destroy cancer cells. checkpoint inhibitors recommended for use before colectomy in d mmr/msi-h cancers include: +pembrolizumab (keytruda) +nivolumab (opdivo) with or without ipilimumab (yervoy) sometimes radiation therapy (alone or with chemotherapy) is given along with systemic therapy for unresectable cancers. for more information on the side effects of checkpoint inhibitors, see the nccn guidelines for patients: immunotherapy side effects: immune checkpoint inhibitors at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" chemotherapy after surgery chemotherapy after surgery chemotherapy is the use of medicine to kill cancer cells. it is a type of systemic therapy. chemotherapy is usually given intravenously. this means the medicine is slowly infused into the bloodstream through a vein. it travels through the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body. chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows your body to recover between cycles. cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. stage 1 chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 1 cancers. stage 2 chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 2a and 2b d mmr/msi-h cancers, but may be given for some stage 2c d mmr/msi-h cancers. chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for some stage 2 p mmr/mss cancers. it is most helpful for cancers with a high risk of recurrence (returning after treatment). your doctor will consider the features and risk factors of the cancer to determine if recurrence is likely. if chemotherapy is planned, recommended regimens include capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)/leucovorin. these are given for 6 months. folfox and capeox are recommended options for high-risk cancers. folfox is given for 6 months; capeox for 3 months. stage 3 chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for all stage 3 colon cancers. preferred regimens include capeox and folfox. other recommended options include capecitabine and 5-fu. chemotherapy is typically given for 3 to 6 months. the length of treatment depends on the regimen and the risk of recurrence. side effects systemic therapy kills both cancer cells and healthy cells. the damage to healthy cells can cause hair loss, cracked skin, mouth sores, and other side effects. managing side effects is a shared effort between you and your care team. it is important to speak up about bothersome side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. ask about your options for managing or relieving the effects of treatment. more information on supportive care is available at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" surveillance surveillance follow-up testing is started when there are no signs of cancer after treatment. it can help find new cancer growth early. stage 1 a colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery for stage 1 cancers. if the results are normal, your next colonoscopy should be in 3 years, and then every 5 years. if a concerning or high-risk adenoma is found, your next colonoscopy will be needed within 1 year. if you don't have any symptoms, other testing is not needed on a regular basis. imaging tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the cancer may have come back or spread. stages 2 and 3 in addition to colonoscopy, surveillance for stages 2 and 3 colon cancer includes physical exams, carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood tests, and ct scans. the recommended schedule for surveillance testing is shown in guide 1. in addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. for more information, see chapter 5: survivorship. guide 1 stages 2 and 3-surveillance after treatment physical exam and cea blood test first 2 years: every 3 to 6 months next 3 years: every 6 months ct of chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 to 12 months for 5 years colonoscopy you did not have a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 3 to 6 months after surgery. you had a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery. if no advanced adenomas are found, repeat in 3 years. after that, repeat every 5 years. 21 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" key points key points polyps with cancer +no further treatment is needed for a malignant pedunculated polyp that was removed in one piece and found to be low risk. +malignant sessile polyps are more likely to return after polypectomy than pedunculated polyps. surgery and observation are options for sessile polyps. invasive cancer +colectomy is needed for cancer that is not found early enough to be removed by polypectomy. if surgery is not possible, systemic therapy is recommended. +if the cancer is advanced or

23 treatment for metastatic cancer \" biomarker testing \" local therapies colon cancer spreads most often to the liver, sometimes to the lungs, and less often to the abdomen or other areas. cancer that has metastasized by the time it is diagnosed is stage 4. biomarker testing biomarkers are targetable features of a cancer. they are often mutations (changes) in particular genes. when possible, biomarker testing is performed on a piece of tumor tissue removed during a biopsy or surgery. if this isn't possible, a sample of blood can be tested. all metastatic colon cancers should be tested for the following biomarkers: +mismatch repair deficiency/high microsatellite instability (d mmr/msi-h) (if not already performed) +ras (kras and nras ) mutations +braf mutations +her2 amplification testing for many biomarkers at one time is called next-generation sequencing (ngs). ngs can find other, rare biomarkers for which targeted treatments may be available, including: +pole/pold1 mutations +ret fusions +ntrk fusions local therapies your treatment options may include local therapies. these are treatments that target liver and lung tumors directly. some are interventional oncology/radiology techniques, also known as image-guided therapies. these techniques use imaging, such as ultrasound or computed tomography (ct), to deliver minimally invasive cancer treatments. using imaging during the procedure allows your doctor to precisely target the tumor(s). a team of experts can determine the best local therapy for your metastatic tumor(s). to learn if surgery or treatment with other local therapies is an option, your case should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of experts. the team should include a surgeon experienced in removing liver and lung tumors and an interventional oncologist/radiologist. resection surgery to remove liver and/or lung tumors is called resection. resection is often preferred for removing colon cancer that has spread to these organs. image-guided thermal ablation (described on the next page) may be used: +with resection, if surgery is not expected to completely remove the tumors +instead of resection, if the tumors are small and can be completely destroyed if a liver resection is needed, your liver may need to be enlarged first. this is done using a minimally invasive procedure called portal 24 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" local therapies vein embolization. an interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into certain veins in the liver. this blocks the blood vessel to the liver tumor, causing the healthy part of the liver to grow. ablation image-guided thermal ablation destroys small liver or lung tumors. a specialized needle is placed directly into or next to the target tumor. this probe delivers targeted energy to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissue. radiofrequency and microwave ablation are commonly used methods that kill cancer cells using heat. cold energy (cryoablation) is used sometimes, mostly for lung tumors. less common types include irreversible electroporation (\"nanoknife\") and laser ablation. thermal ablation may be used in addition to surgery, or alone for small tumors that can be fully removed. it will only be used if all visible areas of cancer can be destroyed. ablation may be performed by either an interventional radiologist or a surgeon. sometimes it can be done in a single session in the interventional radiology department. liver-directed therapies embolization if the cancer has spread only (or mainly) to the liver, treatment with intra-arterial liver-directed therapies may be an option. these therapies may be considered for liver tumors that: +didn't improve (or stopped improving) with chemotherapy, and +cannot be resected or ablated. intra-arterial therapies treat liver tumors with chemotherapy beads (chemoembolization) or radioactive spheres (radioembolization). if radiation spheres are used, it is known as selective internal radiation therapy (sirt) or transarterial hepatic radioembolization (tare). these procedures are performed by interventional oncologists/radiologists. a catheter is inserted into an artery in your leg or wrist and guided to the liver tumor(s). once in place, the spheres or beads are injected into the blood vessel leading to the tumor. they collect inside the tumor and deliver radiation or chemotherapy, causing the cancer cells to die. the chemotherapy beads can also work to starve the tumor by stopping its blood supply. the chemotherapy or radiation further damage the cancer cells and cause the tumor to shrink. when embolization with chemotherapy is not an option, small beads may be used to physically block blood supply to the tumor. this is called bland embolization. haic hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (haic) is chemotherapy given directly to the liver. it is often given in addition to standard intravenous chemotherapy. using a port or pump that is 25 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" local therapies usually placed during surgery to remove liver tumors, the drugs are funneled directly into the artery leading to the liver. haic should only be performed by medical oncologists at treatment centers with experience in this method. stereotactic body radiation therapy stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) is a highly specialized type of external beam radiation therapy (ebrt). it may be used to treat colon cancer that has spread to the liver, lungs, or bone. in sbrt, high doses of radiation are delivered to metastatic tumor(s) using very precise beams. the radiation comes from a large machine outside the body. the radiation passes through skin and other tissue to reach the tumor(s). treatment with sbrt is typically complete in 5 or fewer sessions, called fractions. stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) sbrt may be used to treat colon cancer that has spread to the liver, lungs, or bone. high doses of radiation are delivered to a metastatic site or sites using very precise beams. treatment is typically given in 5 or fewer sessions. 26 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs when possible, surgery and systemic therapy is the recommended treatment approach for these cancers. the choice of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) depends on the mismatch repair (mmr) status of the cancer. surgery involves colectomy to remove the colon tumor. the liver or lung tumors are resected when the colectomy is performed, or later as a separate surgery. if the metastatic tumors are small, removing or destroying them with local therapies may be an option--alone or with surgery. p mmr/mss cancer your doctor may recommend 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy before, after, or between surgeries. this is in addition to the chemotherapy that is recommended for everyone after surgery, called adjuvant chemotherapy. the goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to kill any cancer cells that may remain in the body. either folfox or capeox is preferred. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. after chemotherapy, surveillance begins. if all areas of cancer cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies, stage 4 colon cancer is treated with systemic therapy. systemic therapy given first is called first-line therapy. recommended first-line regimens are listed below. the targeted therapy bevacizumab (avastin) may be added to any of these regimens: +folfiri +folfox +capeox +folfirinox for some p mmr/mss cancers, folfiri or folfox may be given with a targeted therapy--either panitumumab (vectibix) or cetuximab (erbitux). these regimens are only recommended for tumors without ras (kras or nras) or braf mutations. while uncommon, systemic therapy may shrink the tumors enough to be removed with surgery and/or local therapies. after surgery, most people will have more systemic therapy. in some cases, observation or a short course of chemotherapy may be possible. if the tumors do not become resectable during first-line therapy, systemic therapy is typically continued. the goal is to slow the growth and spread of the cancer. if the cancer progresses, the regimen you receive next may be different from what you had before. the choice will depend on prior systemic therapy you've had and how well you are expected to tolerate certain regimens. another important factor is whether the tumor has any biomarkers. regimens targeting specific biomarkers are listed in guide 2 on the next page. 27 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs if the cancer progresses through all available regimens, recommended options if you are eligible include: +targeted therapy with fruquintinib (fruzaqla) +chemotherapy with trifluridine and tipiracil (lonsurf) +targeted therapy with regorafenib (stivarga) all are tablets taken by mouth. the targeted therapy bevacizumab may be given with lonsurf. d mmr/msi-h or pole/pold1-mutated cancer the preferred treatment approach for resectable stage 4 d mmr/msi-h or pole/ pold1-mutated cancers is immunotherapy followed by surgery. immunotherapy is only recommended if you haven't already had treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. recommended options include: +nivolumab (opdivo), which may be given with ipilimumab (yervoy) +pembrolizumab (keytruda) +dostarlimab-gxly (jemperli) guide 2 biomarker-based treatments for p mmr/mss cancers braf v600e mutation

guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the abdomen another recommended treatment approach for these cancers is surgery followed by chemotherapy. either folfox or capeox is preferred. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. if all areas of cancer cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies, stage 4 colon cancer is treated with systemic therapy. if you are a candidate and haven't had immunotherapy, treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is recommended. your doctor will check the extent of the cancer every 2 to 3 months. surgery may become possible. or you may continue immunotherapy or switch to a different systemic therapy. if you've already had immunotherapy, another type of systemic therapy is recommended. stage 4 cancer in the abdomen some people with metastatic colon cancer will also form tumors in the layer of tissue that lines the abdomen, called the peritoneum. the peritoneum covers most of the abdominal organs. in most cases, systemic therapy is given with the goal of relieving or preventing symptoms. the regimen you receive will depend on whether the tumor has any biomarkers and how well you are expected to tolerate certain systemic therapies. tumors growing in or around the bowel can block stool from moving and leaving the body. in this case, the bowel needs to be unblocked before starting systemic therapy. this is done using one of several surgical techniques, or with a mesh metal tube called a stent. cytoreductive surgery and hipec in a small number of people, cytoreductive surgery and/or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) may be treatment options. but research is needed on whether the benefits of these treatments outweigh the possible harms. they are only used in specialized centers and under certain circumstances. cytoreductive surgery involves surgically removing all visible tumors. if the tumor cannot be separated from the surface of an organ, the organ may also need to be removed. in hipec, a heated chemotherapy solution is put directly into the abdominal cavity through small tubes called catheters. 29 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" surveillance surveillance surveillance after treatment for stage 4 colon cancer includes: +colonoscopies +physical exams +carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood tests +computed tomography (ct) scans the recommended schedule for surveillance testing is shown in guide 3. in addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. for more information, see chapter 5: survivorship. guide 3 surveillance after treatment for stage 4 colon cancer physical exam and cea blood test first 2 years: every 3 to 6 months next 3 years: every 6 months ct of chest, abdomen, and pelvis first 2 years: every 3 to 6 months next 3 years: every 6 to 12 months colonoscopy you did not have a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 3 to 6 months after surgery. you had a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery. if no advanced adenomas are found, repeat in 3 years. after that, repeat every 5 years. it's ok to have bad days but don't let yourself stay there. a positive attitude goes a long way. \"\" 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" distant recurrence distant recurrence after treatment for non-metastatic colon cancer, the cancer may return and spread to the liver, lungs, or other areas. this is called a distant recurrence. treatment with surgery and/or local therapies is recommended if all of the tumors can be totally removed. but, this is uncommon, and most distant recurrences are treated with systemic therapy. systemic therapy may shrink the tumors enough to be removed with surgery. if your doctor thinks this might be possible, the size of the tumors will be checked about every 2 months during systemic therapy. if the cancer does not become resectable, systemic therapy is typically continued. the goal is to slow the growth and spread of the cancer. specific recommendations are provided below according to the mismatch repair status of the cancer and whether resection is possible. unresectable p mmr/mss cancer if you've had recent treatment with folfox or capeox, you should not have more chemotherapy that includes oxaliplatin. oxaliplatin can cause serious nerve damage. your options for systemic therapy will depend, in part, on whether the cancer has any biomarkers. therapies targeting the biomarkers listed below are available: +her2 amplification +kras g12c mutation +braf mutations +ntrk gene fusion +ret gene fusion for cancers without biomarkers, chemotherapy with folfiri or irinotecan is a recommended first-line option. a biologic may be given with chemotherapy. biologics include bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, ramucirumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab. resectable p mmr/mss cancer if you have received treatment with chemotherapy, one recommended option is resection (and/or treatment with local therapies) first, followed by either chemotherapy or observation. observation is preferred for those who have already had treatment with oxaliplatin. a second option is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection (and/or treatment with local therapies). more chemotherapy may follow. if you have not had any chemotherapy, resection (and/or treatment with local therapies) is often performed first, followed by chemotherapy. folfox and capeox are preferred for chemotherapy. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. a second option for those who haven't had any chemotherapy is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection and/or treatment with local therapies. more chemotherapy may follow. 31 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" distant recurrence unresectable d mmr/msi-h or pole/pold1-mutated cancer if you are a candidate and haven't had immunotherapy, treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is recommended. your doctor will check the extent of the cancer every 2 to 3 months. surgery may become possible. or, you may continue immunotherapy or switch to a different systemic therapy. if you've already had immunotherapy, another type of systemic therapy is recommended. this may be oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy such as folfox or capeox. or, if the cancer has any other biomarkers, targeted therapy may be an option. resectable d mmr/msi-h or pole/ pold1-mutated cancer there are 2 options for treating resectable, distant recurrences of d mmr/msi-h cancer. local therapies may be used together with resection, or used alone for very small tumors. if you have not had immunotherapy, recommended options include: +immunotherapy, followed by observation or resection +resection followed by chemotherapy if you have received checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, one recommended option is resection first, followed by either chemotherapy or observation. observation is recommended for those who have already had treatment with oxaliplatin. a second option is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection. more chemotherapy may follow. supportive care is available for everyone with cancer. it isn't meant to treat the cancer, but rather to help with symptoms and make you more comfortable. 32 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" clinical trials clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase 1 trials study the safety and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. +phase 2 trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase 3 trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase 4 trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. take time to discuss with family, friends, or others whom you trust. keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. start the conversation don't wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. if you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the requirements. try not to be discouraged if you cannot join. new clinical trials are always becoming available. 33 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" clinical trials frequently asked questions there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. are clinical trials free? there is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. the study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. you may, however, have costs indirectly related to the trial, such as the cost of transportation or child care due to extra appointments. during the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. this care is billed to--and often covered by-- insurance. you are responsible for copays and any costs for this care that are not covered by your insurance. finding a clinical trial in the united states nccn cancer centers nccn. org/cancercenters the national cancer

points biomarker testing +everyone with metastatic colon cancer should have biomarker tumor testing that includes d mmr/msi-h (if not already done), ras and braf mutations, and her2 amplification. +next-generation sequencing (ngs) can find other rare biomarkers for which targeted treatments may be available, including: pole/pold1 mutations; ret fusions; and ntrk fusions. local therapies for liver and lung tumors +treatment options for metastatic colon cancer may include local therapies, such as image-guided thermal ablation and stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt). +these treatments may be used in addition to or in place of surgery if all areas of cancer can be removed. +to learn if surgery or treatment with other local therapies is an option, your case should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of experts. stage 4 colon cancer +when possible, treatment with surgery and systemic therapy is recommended. the choice of chemotherapy or immunotherapy depends on the mismatch repair status of the cancer. +stage 4 cancer that cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies is treated with systemic therapy. +for colon cancer that has spread to the peritoneum, systemic therapy is usually given. the goal is to relieve or prevent symptoms. distant recurrence +the return and spread of stage 1, 2, or 3 colon cancer to areas far from the colon is called a distant recurrence. +most distant recurrences are treated with systemic therapy. clinical trials +clinical trials provide access to investigational treatments that may, in time, be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). as the care partner for my stage iv husband, i would share that you must advocate for them. however, be respectful of their feelings and ensure you're communicating your research/questions with them. i always reviewed my list of questions and concerns with my husband on the way to our appointments in case i had something on my list that he might not want asked or answered. \"\" 35 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 20245 survivorship 36 your primary care doctor 36 help with side effects 37 paying for care 38 healthy habits 39

effects survivorship focuses on the physical, emotional, and financial issues faced by cancer survivors. managing the long-term side effects of cancer and its treatment, staying connected with your primary care doctor, and living a healthy lifestyle are important parts of survivorship. your primary care doctor after finishing cancer treatment, your primary care doctor will play an important role in your care. your oncologist (cancer doctor) and primary care physician (pcp) should work together to make sure you get the follow-up care you need. ask your oncologist for a written survivorship care plan. ideally, the plan will include: +a summary of your cancer treatment history +a description of possible late-and long-term side effects +recommendations for monitoring for the return of cancer +information on when your care will be transferred to your pcp +clear roles and responsibilities for your cancer doctor and your pcp +recommendations on your overall health and well-being help with side effects colon cancer survivors may experience both short-and long-term health effects of cancer and its treatment. the effects depend in part on the treatment(s) received. surgery, anti-cancer medicines, and radiation therapy all have unique potential side effects. diarrhea or incontinence colon surgery can cause changes to your bowel habits. you may experience changes in the frequency or urgency of your bowel movements. diarrhea refers to having frequent and watery bowel movements. incontinence is the inability to control urination (urinary incontinence) or bowel movements (fecal incontinence). the following may help with these side effects: +anti-diarrhea medicines +changing your diet +strengthening your pelvic floor +wearing protective undergarments nerve damage the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin can damage nerves in your fingers and toes. symptoms include numbness, cramping, tingling, or pain in these areas. acupuncture and heat may help. if you have painful nerve damage, a drug called duloxetine (cymbalta) may help. ostomy care if you have an ostomy, you may want to join an ostomy support group. another option is to 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024survivorship \" paying for care see a health care provider that specializes in ostomy care, such as an ostomy nurse. people with ostomies can still live very active lifestyles. however, it's a good idea to talk to an ostomy professional before doing any intense physical activity. paying for care cancer survivors face a unique financial burden. paying for doctor visits, tests, and treatments can become unmanageable, especially for those with little or no health insurance. you may also have costs not directly related to treatment, such as travel expenses and the cost of childcare or missed work. the term financial toxicity is used to describe the problems patients face related to the cost of medical care. financial toxicity can affect your quality of life and access to needed health care. if you need help paying for your cancer care, financial assistance may be available. talk with a patient navigator, your treatment team's social worker, and your hospital's financial services department. some of the resources listed on page 46 contain helpful information on paying for cancer care. i am a stage iii colon cancer survivor. i would recommend taking it one day at a time, 1 hour if necessary. get a second opinion to feel confident in your treatment plan. lastly, connect with others who have been where you are. peer support

important to keep up with other aspects of your health after cancer treatment. steps you can take to help prevent other health problems and to improve your quality of life are described next. cancer screening and other care get screened for other types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, and skin cancer. your primary care doctor can advise you on which screening tests you should have based on your age and risk level. other health care get other recommended health care for your age, such as blood pressure screening, hepatitis c screening, and immunizations (like the flu shot). diet and exercise try to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week. alcohol may increase the risk of certain cancers. drink little to no alcohol. a low glycemic load (gl) diet may help prevent the return of colon cancer. low gl foods cause a slower and smaller rise in blood sugar levels compared to other carbohydrate-containing foods. talk to your doctor about a low glycemic load diet. aspirin talk to your doctor about the possible risks and benefits of long-term aspirin therapy to help prevent the return of colorectal cancers. quit smoking if you smoke or vape, quit! your doctor will be able to provide (or refer you for) counseling on how to stop smoking. experts recommend eating a diet that includes a lot of plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. 39 nccn guidelines

share information, discuss the options, and agree on a treatment plan. it starts with an open and honest conversation between you and your care team. treatment decisions are very personal. what is important to you may not be important to someone else. some things that may play a role in your decision-making: +what you want and how that might differ from what others want +your religious and spiritual beliefs +your feelings about certain treatments +your feelings about pain or side effects +cost of treatment, travel to treatment centers, and time away from school or work +quality of life and length of life +how active you are and the activities that are important to you think about what you want from treatment. discuss openly the risks and benefits of specific treatments and procedures. weigh options and share concerns with your care team. if you take the time to build a relationship with your care team, it will help you feel supported when considering options and making treatment decisions. second opinion it is normal to want to start treatment as soon as possible. while cancer can't be ignored, there is time to have another doctor review your test results and suggest a treatment plan. this is called getting a second opinion, and it's a normal part of cancer care. even doctors get second opinions! things you can do to prepare: +check with your insurance company about its rules on second opinions. there may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors who are not part of your insurance plan. +make plans to have copies of all your records sent to the doctor you will see for your second opinion. support groups many people diagnosed with cancer find support groups to be helpful. support groups often include people at different stages of treatment. some people may be newly diagnosed, while others may be finished with treatment. if your hospital or community doesn't have support groups for people with cancer, check out the websites listed in this

aggressive cancer where cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. this causes the breast to look red and swollen and feel warm to the touch. the breast the breast is an organ and a gland found on the chest. the breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue. behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs. muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place. breast tissue contains glands that can make milk. these milk glands are called lobules. lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple. the ring of darker breast skin is called the areola. the raised tip within the areola is called the nipple. the nipple-areola complex (nac) is a term that refers to both parts. lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food. it also helps to fight germs. lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla). nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (alns) invasive ductal carcinoma most inflammatory breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer basics \" breast cancer 6 breast cancer basics \" breast cancer \" inflammatory breast cancer breast cancer breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast. almost all breast cancers are a subtype called carcinomas. carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body. there are different types of breast carcinoma. the most common types are either ductal or lobular. +ductal carcinoma starts in the cells that line the milk ducts. milk ducts are thin tubes that carry milk from the lobules of the breast to the nipple. it is the most common type of breast cancer. +lobular carcinoma starts in the lobules (milk glands) of the breast. it is the second most common type of breast cancer. inflammatory breast cancer most inflammatory breast cancers (ibcs) are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. it's important not to dismiss any strange skin changes to the breast, including redness, swollen nipple area, or warmth to the touch. seek medical attention right away. possible signs of ibc: +peau d'orange (pitted or dimpled appearance of skin) +skin thickening (skin has an orange-peel texture) +edema (swelling caused by excess fluid in body tissue) +erythema (reddening of the skin, usually in patches) inflammatory breast cancer in inflammatory breast cancer (ibc), cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. this causes the breast to look red and swollen and feel warm to the touch. 7 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast

assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders. key points +anyone can develop breast cancer, but breast cancer occurs more frequently in persons assigned female at birth. +inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and connective tissue. lobules are structures that make breast milk. ducts carry breast milk from the lobules to the nipple.

patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" test results treatment planning starts with testing. this chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. ibc can be difficult to diagnose. often, there is no lump that can be felt during a breast exam or seen on a mammogram. since there is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema) of the breast, ibc can look like an infection and therefore be difficult to diagnose. often, a biopsy of the affected skin is done to diagnose the tumor. test results you will have blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to stage the cancer. the biopsy sample will be tested for hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and her2 receptors. treatment will be based on these findings. it is important you understand what these tests mean. ask questions and keep copies of your test results. online patient portals are a great way to access your test results. keep these things in mind: +choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment. +bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. +write down questions and take notes during appointments. don't be afraid to ask your care team questions. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. +get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. +organize your papers. create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. you can do the same on your computer. +keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. add it to your phone. hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. keep your primary care physician (pcp) informed of changes to this list. +include in your contact list information on the exact type of cancer, as well as any treatments and the date they started. for possible tests, see guide 1. 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" general health tests general health tests medical history a medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (otc) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. some supplements interact and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. tell your care team about any symptoms you have. a medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. family history some cancers and other diseases can run in families. your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. this information is called a family history. ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. it's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing. guide 1 possible tests medical history and physical exam (h&p) by multidisciplinary team. medical photographs will also be taken. complete blood count (cbc), comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) including liver function tests (lfts), and alkaline phosphatase biopsy with pathology review determine tumor status including: estrogen receptor (er) and progesterone receptor (pr) hormone receptor (hr) status her2 status address fertility, birth control, and sexual health concerns genetic counseling and testing if at risk for hereditary breast cancer imaging: diagnostic mammogram. ultrasound and breast mri, as needed chest ct. contrast might be used. ct or mri of abdomen with or without pelvis. contrast will be used. bone scan or pet-ct 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f

breathing rate +check your height and weight +listen to your lungs and heart +look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat +feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. +examine your breasts to look for lumps, nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin changes. +feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. clinical breast exam clinical breast exam (cbe) is a physical exam of the bare breast performed by a health care provider to check for lumps or other changes. it is done while you are seated and/or lying down. your provider should take time to palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the armpit. a nurse or assistant might also be in the room during the exam. create a medical binder a medical binder or notebook is a great way to organize all of your records in one place. 3make copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about your specific type of cancer. it will be helpful when getting a second opinion. 3choose a binder that meets your needs. consider a zipper pocket to include a pen, small calendar, and insurance cards. 3create folders for insurance forms, test types (ie, blood, imaging, pathology, radiology, genetics), treatments, and procedures. organize items in the folder by date. 3use online patient portals to view your test results and other records. download or print the records to add to your binder. 3add a section for questions and to take notes. bring your medical binder to appointments. you never know when you might need it! 12 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" fertility (all genders) 12 testing for ibc \" fertility (all genders) \" preventing pregnancy during treatment fertility (all genders) treatment such as chemotherapy can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. if you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. to preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't really sure at the moment. fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. more information on fertility preservation in adolescents and young adults can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. changes in fertility treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily or permanently impaired or interrupted. this loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy. preventing pregnancy during treatment preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. cancer and cancer treatment can affect the ovaries and damage sperm. hormonal birth control may or may not be recommended, so ask your doctor about options such as intrauterine devices (iuds) and barrier methods. types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. those with ovaries those who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test before starting treatment. cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby if you are or become pregnant during treatment. therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy during and after treatment is recommended. non-hormonal birth control methods (barrier methods, iuds) are preferred after a breast cancer diagnosis. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be avoided. menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your \"period\" may stop during treatment, but often returns within 2 years after treatment in those 35 years of age and under. it is still possible to become pregnant even though you might not have a period. therefore, birth control is recommended during and after treatment. consult your doctor for the best time to plan a pregnancy. those with testicles cancer and cancer treatment can damage sperm. therefore, use contraception (birth control) such as condoms and iuds to prevent 13 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" blood tests pregnancy during and immediately after cancer treatment. blood tests blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. they require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into your vein. some blood tests you might have are described next. alkaline phosphatase alkaline phosphatase (alp) is an enzyme found in the blood. high levels of alp can be a sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. a bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of alp. complete blood count a complete blood count (cbc) measures the levels of red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs), and platelets (plts) in your blood. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding. comprehensive metabolic panel a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) measures 14 different substances in your blood. it is usually done on the plasma part of your blood. a cmp provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. liver function tests liver function tests (lfts) look at the health of your liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or that cancer has spread to the liver. pregnancy test those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist before starting treatment. 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests imaging tests imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. a radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. the doctor will discuss the results with you. while these reports are available to you through your patient portal, please wait to discuss these results with the doctor. the following imaging tests are not in order of importance. you will not have all of these tests. bone scan a bone scan uses a radiotracer. a radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. it can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. however, the test is quick and painless. a special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health issues. bone x-ray an x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one picture at a time. a tumor changes the way radiation is absorbed and will show up on the x-ray. x-rays are also good at showing bone issues. your care team may order x-rays if your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone scan. diagnostic mammogram a mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. the pictures are made using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. a bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. mammogram results are used to plan treatment. diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen on screening mammograms. they are used to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s). diagnostic mammograms include extra compression in certain areas of the breast, magnification views, or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast. other tests may include a breast mri or ultrasound. mri scan a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. it does not use x-rays. because of the very strong magnets used in the mri machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body. during the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. contrast is often used. a closed mri has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. an open mri has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. closed mris are more common than open mris, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests breast mri if needed, a breast mri will be used in addition to a mammogram. contrast should be used. you will be positioned face down in the machine with your arms above your head. spine and brain mri an mri can be used to detect breast cancer that has spread (metastasize) to your spine or brain. for a brain mri, a device is placed around your head. for a spine mri, no device is worn. contrast should be used in an mri. ct scan a computed tomography (ct or cat) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. it takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. all the images are combined to make one detailed picture. intravenous (iv) contrast is often used. contrast material contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body. contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. it is used to make the pictures clearer. the contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine immediately after the test. the types of contrast vary and are different for ct and mri. tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past, especially to iodine or to shellfish such as shrimp. this is important. you might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies. contrast what's the difference between a screening and diagnostic mammogram? a mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast made using x-rays. during a mammogram, the breast is pressed between two plates while you stand in different positions. multiple x-rays will be taken. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. screening mammograms are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. results take a few days. diagnostic mammograms are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or whose breasts have changed shape or size. diagnostic mammograms are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram. a radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away. both types of mammograms use low-dose x-rays to examine the breast. they may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2d) digital mammography or 3-dimensional (3d) mammograms known as tomosynthesis. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well. pet scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. a tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow. cancer cells show up as bright spots on pet scans. however, not all tumors will appear on a pet scan. also, not all bright spots are cancer. it is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on pet. inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. when a pet scan is combined with ct, it is called a pet-ct scan. it may be done with one or two machines depending on the cancer center. sodium fluoride pet-ct a sodium fluoride pet-ct might be used instead of a bone scan. in this test, the radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride. fdg pet-ct an fdg pet-ct uses a radiotracer called f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg). it is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose. you cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan. this scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear. it may help find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites. if it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride pet-ct may not be needed. fdg pet-ct can be done at the same time as a ct used for diagnosis. fes pet-ct fes is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen. it might be used instead of fdg pet-ct when cancer is estrogen receptor-positive (er+). ultrasound an ultrasound (us) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body. this is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy. a wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your bare breast using gel. it may also be placed below your armpit. ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed. ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that are near the skin. sometimes, a breast ultrasound or mri is used to guide a biopsy. inflammatory breast cancer can be difficult to diagnose. ask for a referral to a breast specialist, if possible. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy biopsy a biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample of tissue or fluid. the sample is sent to a lab for testing. a pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment. there are different types of biopsies. some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as mammogram, ultrasound, or mri. the primary or main tumor is biopsied first. other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. you may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both. types of possible biopsies include: +fine-needle aspiration (fna) or core biopsy (cb) uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. in a vacuum-assisted core biopsy (vacb), suction is used to remove the sample with a special vacuum device. +incisional biopsy removes a small amount of tissue through a cut in the skin or body. +excisional biopsy removes the entire abnormal area. this is not the preferred type of biopsy but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don't match the expected findings. +skin biopsy takes a small sample of inflamed skin on the breast. before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine. a core needle biopsy (cnb) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast. the samples are small. biopsy in a biopsy, a sample of tumor is removed. there are different types of biopsy. this image shows an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy the needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging. when mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy. one or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy. the clips are small, painless, and made of metal. they will mark the site for future treatment and imaging. the clips will stay in place until surgery. if the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. the clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time. you will be able to go through airport security and have an mri. there are both physical and emotional experiences in having biopsies. you may need to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy area after the procedure. if you are working or have other commitments, you may want to take the day off to recover emotionally and physically from the experience. axillary lymph node needle biopsy an axillary lymph node (aln) drains lymph fluid from the breast and nearby areas. in an axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with a needle. this is to determine if abnormal lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain cancer cells. an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (us-fna) or core biopsy will be used. if cancer is found, it is called node positive (node+). a marker may be placed in the node so that it can be identified later if needed. standard of care is the best known way to treat particular disease based on past clinical trials. there may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care. ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy sentinel lymph node biopsy a sentinel lymph node (sln) is the first lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node. removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb or snb). this procedure is done during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. the lymph nodes removed are called the sentinel nodes. they may or may not contain any cancer cells. just because these nodes are removed, it does not mean that they are positive for cancer. to find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive material and other dyes are injected into the area where breast tumor is located. from here, the dye travels through the lymphatics in the breast to the lymph nodes. this helps the surgeon find which of the nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes. once the nodes are found, those containing the radioactive material or dye are removed and tested by a pathologist. if cancer is found, then more than the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed. skin biopsy a sample of inflamed skin on the breast will likely be removed to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer. biopsy results histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under a microscope. it is used to make treatment decisions. your pathology report will contain information about histology. you may be recommended to have an open biopsy (surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor to confirm histology. talk to your health care provider for more information on next steps. 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" hormone receptor status hormone receptor status a hormone is a substance made by a gland in your body. your blood carries hormones throughout your body. a receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell. substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors. this causes changes within the cell. hormones recognize and bind to specific hormone receptors. when hormones attach to receptors on breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow. if found, these receptors may be targeted using endocrine therapy. there are 2 types of hormone receptors: +estrogen-plays a role in breast development +progesterone-plays a role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy hormone receptor (hr) testing should be done on any new tumors. a biopsy sample will be used. hormone receptor-positive in hormone receptor-positive (hr+) breast cancer, ihc finds estrogen and/or progesterone hormone receptors. most breast cancers are hr+. +estrogen receptor (er) is stimulated by estrogen and provides survival and proliferation (rapid growth) signals. cancer cells deprived of estrogen or which have their er signal blocked with treatment may stop growing or die. +progesterone receptor (pr) binds progesterone and also provides survival and proliferation signals. it is thought that pr expression also suggests the tumor is estrogen dependent. hr+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor signaling. hormone receptor-negative hormone receptor-negative (hr-) breast cancer cells do not have either estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors. these cancers are sometimes simply called hormone negative. hr-cancers often grow faster than hr+ cancers. both the estrogen and progesterone receptors need to be negative for the cancer to be considered hr-. estrogen receptor-positive (er+) breast cancer cells 3in er+ breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells. 3in er-low-positive invasive breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 cancer cells. 3endocrine therapy might not be recommended for er-low-positive invasive breast cancer. 21 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" her2 status 21 testing for ibc \" her2 status \" biomarker testing her2 status inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of her2. human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) is a protein involved in normal cell growth. it is found on the surface of all cells. when amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and divide. some breast cancers have too many her2 genes or receptors. too many her2s is called her2-positive (her2+). you might hear it called her2 overexpression or amplification. there are 2 tests for her2: +immunohistochemistry (ihc) measures receptors. if the ihc score is 3+, the cancer is her2+. if the score is 0 or 1, it is considered her2-. if the score is 2+, further testing is needed. +in situ hybridization (ish) counts the number of copies of the her2 gene. this test is done mainly when the ihc score is unclear. her2 testing should be done on all new tumors. a tumor biopsy sample will be used. you might have more than one her2 test. immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry (ihc) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells. these cells are then studied using a microscope. ihc can find estrogen, progesterone, and her2 receptors in breast cancer cells. a pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen and/ or progesterone receptors and the number of receptors inside each cell. biomarker testing a sample from a biopsy of your tumor may be tested to look for specific dna (deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features. this information is used to choose the best treatment for you. it is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). it identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. proteins are written like this: brca. genes are written with italics like this: brca. her2 and hormone receptor status are part of biomarker testing. your treatment team will recommend the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you. tumor markers your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for proteins. examples of some tumor markers in breast cancer include carcinoembryonic antigen (cea), ca 15-3, and ca 27. 29. an increase in the level of certain tumor markers could mean that the cancer has grown or spread (progressed). however, not everyone has elevated levels of these markers and tumor markers alone are not a reliable method of detecting breast cancer. tumor mutational burden when there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor dna, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (tmb-h). tmb-h can be used to help predict response to cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the proteins called programmed 22 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biomarker testing death protein 1 (pd-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1). tumor mutation testing a sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific dna mutations. this is a different type of dna testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your parents. in tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. certain mutations such as pik3ca can be targeted with specific therapies. msi-h/d mmr mutation microsatellites are short, repeated strings of dna. when errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (mmr) proteins. some cancers have dna mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. this is called microsatellite instability (msi) or deficient mismatch repair (d mmr). when cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called msi-h (microsatellite instability-high). this is often due to d mmr genes. pd-1 and pd-l1 testing programmed death protein 1 (pd-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) are immune proteins. if either protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause your immune cells to ignore the cancer and suppress the anti-tumor immune response. if your cancer expresses either protein, you might have treatment that combines chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. this is designed to activate your immune system to better fight off the cancer cells. fish fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) is a testing method that involves special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of dna, the genetic material in a person's cells. immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry (ihc) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cancer or immune cells. the cells are then studied using a microscope. next-generation sequencing next-generation sequencing (ngs) is a high-throughput method used to determine the dna sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in your tumor. this method would only be used if enough tumor tissue remains after other biomarker testing has been completed. pcr a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a lab process that can make millions or billions of copies of your dna (genetic information). pcr is very sensitive. it can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. these copies called pcr product might be used for ngs. 23 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" genetic risk testing genetic risk testing about 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more about your cancer. a genetic counselor or trained provider will speak to you about the results. tests results may be used to guide treatment planning. genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). the goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological parents called germline mutations. some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. you can pass these genes on to your children. also, other family members might carry these mutations. tell your care team if there is a family history of cancer. brca tests everyone has brca genes. normal brca genes help to prevent tumor growth. they help fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally. brca mutations put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. mutations in brca1 or brca2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma skin cancers. mutated brca genes can also affect how well some treatments work. these tests might be repeated. what is your family cancer health history? some cancers and other diseases run in families--those who are related to you through genes passed down from biological parent to child. this information is called a family health history. ask blood relatives about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. for relatives who were diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other relatives if they are no longer living) what type of cancer they had, if they died from the cancer, and at what age the cancer was diagnosed. start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. some of the questions to ask include: 3how old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? 3what is our family's ancestry-from what countries did our ancestors originate? 24 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" distress screening 24 testing for ibc \" distress screening \" key points distress screening it is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can also change from day to day and week to week. talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. there are services and people who can help you. support and counseling are available. dealing with a cancer diagnosis may sometimes be stressful and may cause distress. your treatment team will screen your level of distress. this is part of your cancer care. distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. it can affect how you feel, think, and act. distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. you may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues. more information on distress can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. performance status performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. your state of general health will be rated using a ps scale called ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group). ps is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. your preferences about treatment are always important. ecog ps the ecog ps scores range from 0 to 5. +ps 0 means the person is fully active. +ps 1 means the person is still able to perform light to moderate activity, but with some limitations. +ps 2 means the person is limited to the chair or bed less than half of the time and is still able to care for self. +ps 3 means the person is limited to the chair or bed more than half of the time. +ps 4 means the person is totally confined to the bed or chair and completely unable to care for self. +ps 5 means the person is not alive. in breast cancer, ps might be referred to as good or poor. good ps is usually ps 0 or ps 1. 25 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" key points key points +tests are used to find cancer, plan treatment, and check how well treatment is working. +you will have a physical exam, including a breast exam, to see if anything feels or looks abnormal. +treatment can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. +blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. +imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. +a diagnostic mammogram includes detailed pictures of both breasts. it is different than a screening mammogram. +during a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples are removed for testing. samples are needed to confirm the presence of cancer and to perform cancer cell tests. +a sample from a biopsy of your tumor will be tested for estrogen receptor (er) status, progesterone receptor (pr) status, her2 status, and grade (histology). this provides information about the behavior of your cancer, as well as treatments to which your cancer may respond. +about 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing or to speak with a genetic counselor. +a sentinel lymph node (sln) is the first lymph node(s) that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. a sentinel lymph node biopsy (snlb) might be done to look for cancer in your lymph node(s). +online portals are a great way to access your test results. testing takes time. it might take days or weeks before all test results come in. 26 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 20233 breast cancer staging 27 how breast cancer is staged 28 tnm scores 31 key points 27 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" how breast cancer is staged cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis and to guide treatment decisions. it describes the size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body. it also takes into account hormone receptor and her2 status. most inflammatory breast cancers (ibcs) are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. at diagnosis, ibc is stage 3 or 4 disease. in stage 3, the tumor can be any size and in the lymph nodes, the lymph nodes can be fixed (or not moveable), or the cancer can involve the skin or chest wall. it is sometimes called advanced disease. in stage 4, cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). how breast cancer is staged a cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed. the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) created a staging system to determine how much cancer is in your body, where it is located, and what subtype you have. this is called staging. based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage. staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions. a prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take. ajcc is just one type of staging system. staging includes: +anatomic- based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (t), lymph node status (n), and distant metastasis (m). +prognostic -includes anatomic tnm plus tumor grade and the status of the biomarkers such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2), estrogen receptor (er), and progesterone receptor (pr). prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches. prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic. pathologic stage applies to those who have undergone surgery as the initial treatment for breast cancer. breast cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery. staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status. +clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment. it is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests. an example might look like c n2 or c m1. +pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery. an example might be p n2. if you are given drug therapy before surgery, then the stage might look like yp t3. staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage. often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation. more information can be gathered as treatment begins. doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next. 28 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores information gathered during staging: +the extent (size) of the tumor (t): how large is the cancer? has it grown into nearby areas? +the spread to nearby lymph nodes (n): has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? if so, how many? where? +the spread (metastasis) to distant sites (m): has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver? +estrogen receptor (er) status: does the cancer have the protein called an estrogen receptor? +progesterone receptor (pr) status: does the cancer have the protein called a progesterone receptor? +human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) status: does the cancer make too much of a protein called her2? +grade of the cancer (g): how much do the cancer cells look like normal cells? +biomarker testing: does the cancer have any genes, proteins, markers, or mutations that might suggest treatment?tnm scores the tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage breast cancer. in this system, the letters t, n, and m describe different areas of cancer growth. based on cancer test results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. the higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread. these scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. a tnm example might look like this: t3n2m0 or t32, n2, m0. +t (tumor)-depth and spread of the main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both breasts +n (node) -if cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes +m (metastasis)--if cancer has spread to distant parts of the body or metastasized t = tumor the primary tumor size can be measured in centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). one inch is equal to 2. 54 cm. a large pea is 1 cm (10 mm). a golf ball is 4 cm (40 mm). a tumor micrometastasis is a very small collection of cancerous cells smaller than 1 mm. it might be written as t1mi. ipsilateral means on the same side of the body. +t1 tumor is 2 cm (20 mm) or less +t2 tumor is 2. 1 cm to 5 cm +t3 tumor is more than 5 cm +t4 tumor is of any size and has invaded nearby structures such as the chest wall and skin of the breast t4d tumor is inflammatory carcinoma (inflammatory breast cancer) 29 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores n = regional lymph node lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that help fight infections and other diseases, drains through channels into lymphatic vessels. from here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. there are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout your body. they work as filters to help fight infection and remove harmful things from your body. regional lymph nodes are those located near the tumor in the breast. if breast cancer spreads, it often goes first to nearby lymph nodes under the arm. it can also sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the collarbone or near the breastbone. knowing if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes helps doctors find the best way to treat your cancer. +n0 means no cancer is in the regional lymph nodes. isolated tumor cells (itcs) may be present. these are malignant cell clusters no larger than 0. 2 mm. +n1mi means micrometastases (approximately 200 cells, larger than 0. 2 mm, but not larger than 2. 0 mm) are found in lymph nodes. +n1, n2, n3 means regional lymph node metastases are found. the higher the number, the more lymph nodes that have metastases. m = metastasis cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body is shown as m1. this is metastatic breast cancer (mbc). the most common sites for metastasis are bone and lung. +m0 means no evidence of distant metastasis. +m1 means distant metastasis is found. this is metastatic breast cancer. clinical staging clinical staging of lymph nodes is staging before surgery. cancer is in axillary nodes cancer is in internal mammary nodes cancer is in infraclavicular nodes cancer is in supraclavicular nodes 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores grade grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope (called histology). higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread faster than lower-grade cancers. gx means the grade can't be determined, followed by g1, g2, and g3. g3 is the highest grade for breast cancers. a low-grade tumor has a low risk of recurrence. a high-grade tumor has a higher risk of recurrence (of cancer returning). +gx-grade cannot be determined +g1-low +g2-intermediate +g3-high numbered stages numbered stages are based on tnm scores and receptor (hormone and her2) status. stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4 being the most advanced. they might be written as stage 0, stage i, stage ii, stage iii, and stage iv. stage 0 is noninvasive noninvasive breast cancer is rated stage 0. ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) is found only in the ducts (tis). it has not spread to the surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes (n0) or distant sites (m0). stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1, 2, or 3. it has grown outside the ducts, lobules, or breast skin. cancer might be in the axillary lymph nodes. stage 4 is metastatic in stage 4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to distant sites. it can develop from earlier stages. sometimes, the first diagnosis is stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (called de novo). more information on metastatic breast cancer is available at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 31 nccn guidelines for

this chapter provides an overview of treatment options and what to expect. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. care team treating breast cancer takes a team approach. treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (mdt). an mdt is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer. this team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. ask who will coordinate your care. some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. depending on your diagnosis, the care team might include the following: +a diagnostic radiologist interprets the results of mammograms, ultrasounds, and other imaging tests. +an interventional radiologist performs needle biopsies and places intravenous (iv) ports for treatment. +a pathologist analyzes the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy and provides cancer diagnosis, staging, and information about biomarker testing. +a surgical oncologist performs operations to remove cancer. +a reconstructive (plastic) surgeon performs breast reconstruction, if desired, for those who undergo mastectomy. +a medical oncologist treats cancer in adults using systemic therapy. +a radiation oncologist prescribes and delivers radiation therapy to treat cancer. +an anesthesiologist gives anesthesia, a medicine so you do not feel pain during surgery or procedures. +residents and fellows are doctors who are continuing their training, some to become specialists in a certain field of medicine. +nurse practitioners (nps) and physician assistants (pas) are health care providers. some of your clinic visits may be done by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. +oncology nurses provide your hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy, managing your care, answering questions, and helping you cope with side effects. +oncology pharmacists are experts in knowing how to use medicines to treat cancer and to manage symptoms and side effects. +palliative care nurses, advanced practice providers (apps), and physicians help provide an extra layer of support with cancer-related care. +radiation therapists provide your hands-on delivery of radiotherapy treatments. 34 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" treatment overview +nutritionists and dietitians can provide guidance on what foods are most suitable for your condition. +psychologists and psychiatrists are mental health experts who can help manage issues such as depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions that can affect how you think and feel. +social workers help people solve and cope with problems in their everyday lives. clinical social workers also diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional issues. the anxiety a person feels when diagnosed with cancer might be managed by a social worker in some cancer centers. they, or other designated professionals, can help navigate the complexities of financial and insurance stresses. +a research team helps to collect research data and coordinate care if you are in a clinical trial. clinical trials help bring new therapies to patients and advance the treatment for everyone. consider asking your care team about access to clinical trials. your physical, mental, and emotional well-being are important. help other team members understand: +how you feel +what you need +what is working and what is not keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. this will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know whom to contact with questions or concerns. treatment overview inflammatory breast cancer is treatable. treatment can be local, systemic, or usually a combination of both. local therapy focuses on the breast, chest wall, and lymph node area. it includes: +mastectomy (surgery) +radiation therapy systemic therapy works throughout the body. it includes: +chemotherapy +her2-targeted therapy +inhibitors +immunotherapy +endocrine therapy for a list of systemic therapies, see guide 2. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. 35 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" treatment overview ibc is treated with systemic therapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the breast and lymph nodes, and then radiation therapy. surgery is not always possible. even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue. systemic treatment is based on estrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr), and her2 expression. it is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan. there are many treatment options. however, not everyone will respond to treatment in the same way. some people will do better than expected. others will do worse. many factors play a role in how the cancer will respond to treatment.

combination therapy of trastuzumab with pertuzumab 36 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" mastectomy mastectomy surgery is an operation or procedure to remove cancer from the body. a mastectomy removes all or part of the breast. inflammatory breast cancer is often treated with a modified radical mastectomy. in a modified radical mastectomy, the breast and underarm (axilla) sentinel lymph nodes are removed. before removing the breast, the surgeon may do a sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb). sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have spread from the primary tumor. breast reconstruction is an option after a mastectomy. if you opt for reconstruction, it will be done after finishing cancer treatment. this is called delayed reconstruction. breast reconstruction is often done in stages. you might want to consult with a plastic surgeon. when preparing for surgery, seek the opinion of an experienced surgeon. the surgeon should be an expert in performing your type of surgery. hospitals that perform many surgeries often have better results. you can ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of cancer. radiation therapy radiation therapy (rt) uses high-energy radiation from x-rays, photons, protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. radiation therapy can be given alone or before or after surgery to treat or slow the growth of cancer. sometimes, radiation is given with certain systemic therapies. it may be used as supportive care to help ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer. most types of radiation include several short treatment modified radical mastectomy the dotted line shows where the entire breast and some lymph nodes are removed. part of the chest wall muscle may also be removed. 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" chemotherapy 37 treating ibc \" chemotherapy \" chemotherapy sessions that are given once daily over a few days to weeks. ask your care team which radiation option(s) are best for you and what side effects to expect. radiation may be given to the chest wall, infraclavicular region (below the collarbone), supraclavicular area (above the collarbone), or lymph nodes found in the axillary bed (armpit). lymph node radiation therapy is also called regional nodal irradiation (rni) external beam radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy (ebrt) uses a machine outside of the body called a linear accelerator (linac) to aim radiation at the whole breast (wbrt) and lymph nodes (rni). chemotherapy systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. it is used before surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of cancer (called cancer burden). +preoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given before surgery. it is also called neoadjuvant therapy. +postoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given after surgery. it is also called adjuvant therapy. chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and some normal cells. more than one chemotherapy may be used to treat inflammatory breast cancer. when only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. a combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs. warnings about supplements and drug interactions you might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. some supplements can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. this is called a drug interaction. it is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. some examples include: +turmeric +gingko biloba +green tea extract +st. john's wort +antioxidants certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. antacids, heart or blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy. therefore, it is very important to tell your care team about any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter (otc) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. bring a list with you to every visit. 38 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" myeloid growth factors some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein or injected under the skin with a needle. other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed. some examples of chemotherapy drugs include: +doxorubicin (adriamcyin), doxorubicin liposomal injection (doxil), and epirubicin (ellence) are anthracyclines. +docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel are taxanes. +capecitabine (xeloda), fluorouracil, gemcitabine (gemzar, infugem), and methotrexate are antimetabolites. most chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows the body to recover before the next cycle. cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. the number of treatment days per cycle and the total number of cycles given also vary. myeloid growth factors certain chemotherapies can reduce the cells that fight infection. treatments with myeloid growth factors (mgfs) can help increase the number of white blood cells and prevent infections. more information on myeloid growth factors, can be found in the nccn guidelines for patients: anemia and neutropenia, at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. her2-targeted therapy her2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. there might be higher amounts of her2 in your breast cancer. if this is the case, it is called her2-positive (her2+) breast cancer. her2-targeted therapy is drug therapy that treats her2+ breast cancer. most often, her2-targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy. however, it might be used alone or in combination with endocrine therapy. her2-targeted therapies include: +her2 antibodies prevent growth signals from her2 from outside the cell. they also increase the attack of immune cells on cancer cells. +her2 inhibitors stop growth signals from her2 from within the cell. +her2 conjugates or antibody drug conjugates (adcs) deliver cell- specific chemotherapy. they attach to her2s then enter the cell. once inside, chemotherapy is released. your heart will be monitored before and during treatment with trastuzumab. tests will measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart. 39 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" inhibitors 39 treating ibc \" inhibitors \" immunotherapy inhibitors this section is for inhibitors that are different from inhibitors used in her2-targeted therapy. cdk4/6 inhibitors cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. for hormone receptor-positive (hr+), her2-cancer, taking a cdk4/6 inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help control cancer longer. with all cdk4/6 regimens, those who are premenopausal must also receive ovarian ablation or suppression. cdk4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib (verzenio), palbociclib (ibrance), and ribociclib (kisqali). m tor inhibitors m tor is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. endocrine therapy may stop working if m tor becomes overactive. m tor inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy working again. everolimus (afinitor) is an m tor inhibitor. most often, it is taken with exemestane. for some, it may be taken with fulvestrant or tamoxifen. parp inhibitors cancer cells often become damaged. parp is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and allows them to survive. blocking parp can cause cancer cells to die. olaparib (lynparza) and talazoparib (talzenna) are parp inhibitors. you must have the brca1 or brca2 mutation and your breast cancer must be her2-for parp inhibitors to be considered. pik3ca inhibitor the pik3ca gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancers. a mutation in this gene can lead to increased growth of cancer cells and resistance to various treatments. alpelisib (piqray) is an example of a pik3ca inhibitor. immunotherapy immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment that tries to re-activate the immune system against tumor cells. the immune system has many on and off switches. tumors take advantage of \"off switches. \" two leading off switches are pd-1 and ctla4. immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. an immunotherapy example is pembrolizumab (keytruda). did you know? the terms \"chemotherapy\" and \"systemic therapy\" are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. systemic therapy works throughout the body and includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, and others. 40 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" endocrine therapy endocrine therapy endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or progesterone to treat hormone receptor-positive (hr+) breast cancer. the endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. hormones are natural chemicals released into the bloodstream. there are 4 hormones that might be targeted in endocrine therapy: +estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries, and also by other tissues in the body such as the fat tissue. +progesterone is made mainly by the ovaries. +luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) is made by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. it tells the ovaries to make estrogen and progesterone and testicles to make testosterone. lhrh is also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh). +androgen is made by the adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries. hormones may cause breast cancer to grow. endocrine therapy will stop your body from making hormones or it will block what hormones do in the body. this can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time. endocrine therapy is sometimes called hormone therapy. it is not the same as hormone replacement therapy used for menopause. there is one type of surgical endocrine therapy: +bilateral oophorectomy is surgery to remove both ovaries. other main types of endocrine therapy include: +ovarian ablation uses radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones. +ovarian suppression uses drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries from making hormones. it is achieved with drugs called lhrh agonists. these drugs stop lhrh from being made, which stops the ovaries from making hormones. lhrh agonists include goserelin (zoladex) and leuprolide (lupron depot). gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh) agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. +aromatase inhibitors (ais) stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase. they do not

treating cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase i trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. they also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful. +phase ii trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase iii trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if 44 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" clinical trials the

called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it.

clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. do i have to pay to be in a clinical trial? rarely. it depends on the study, your health insurance, and the state in which you live. in general, procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered standard of care will be billed to you or your insurance, whereas those considered research are covered by the trial sponsor. your treatment team and the research team can help determine if you are responsible for any costs. supportive care supportive care will be specific to your needs. supportive care is health care given to prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve quality of life. supportive care might include pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or family counseling. tell your care team how you are feeling and about any side effects so they can be managed. best supportive care, supportive care, and palliative care are often used interchangeably. it is very important to take care of yourself by eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising, and doing things that make you feel energized. strength is needed to sustain you during treatment. side effects all cancer treatments can cause unwanted health issues called side effects. side effects depend on many factors. these factors include the drug type and dose, length of treatment, and the person. some side effects may be harmful to your health. others may just be unpleasant. treatment can cause several side effects. some are very serious. ask for a complete list of side effects of your treatments. also, tell your treatment team about any new or worsening symptoms. there may be ways to help you feel better. there are also ways to prevent some side effects. you will be monitored closely for side effects. late effects late effects are side effects that occur months or years after a disease is diagnosed or after treatment has ended. late effects may be caused by cancer or cancer treatment. they may include physical, mental, and social problems, and second cancers. the sooner it is important to tell your care team about all side effects so they can be managed. 46 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" side effects late effects are treated the better. ask your care team about what late effects could occur. this will help you know what to look for. survivorship a person is a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. when treatment leads to remission (or no evidence of disease), you will need follow-up or survivorship care for late effects. during survivorship care you will still have a care team, but it will look different. seek out peer support groups, whether online or in-person. side effects blood clots cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood clots to form. this can block blood flow and oxygen in the body. blood clots can break loose and travel to other parts of the body causing stroke or other health issues. venous thromboembolism (vte) refers to blood clots in the veins. bone health breast cancer may spread to your bones. some breast cancer treatments may also weaken your bones. both can put your bones at increased risk for injury and disease. such problems include bone fractures, bone pain, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. high levels of calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia, may also occur. medicine may be given to help relieve bone pain and reduce the risk of other bone problems. some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness. it is recommended that you take calcium and vitamin d with these bone health medicines. talk to your doctor first. diarrhea diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel movements. your care team will tell you how to manage diarrhea. it is important to drink lots of fluids. difficulty eating sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer, or its treatment might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to your stomach

drinking enough fluids. a registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food can help. speak to your care team if you have trouble eating or maintaining weight. distress depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are common and are a normal part of cancer diagnosis. talk to your care team and with those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. there are services, people, and medicine that can help you. support and counseling services are available. fatigue fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to function due to lack of energy. fatigue may be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of treatment. let your care team know how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of doing the things you enjoy. eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage therapy can help. you might be referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue. hair loss chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia) all over your body -- not just on your scalp. some chemotherapy drugs are more likely than others to cause hair loss. dosage might also affect the amount of hair loss. most of the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is temporary. hair often regrows 3 to 6 months after treatment ends. your hair may be a different shade or texture. scalp cooling (or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen hair loss in those receiving certain types of chemotherapy. keep a pain diary a pain diary is a written record that helps you keep track of when you have pain, how bad it is, what causes it, and what makes it better or worse. use a pain diary to discuss your pain with your care team. you might be referred to a specialist for pain management. include in your pain diary: 3the time and dose of all medicines 3when pain starts and ends or lessens 3where you feel pain 3a description of your pain. is it throbbing, sharp, tingling, shooting, or burning? is it constant, or does it come and go? 3does the pain change at different

risk for bleeding. lymphedema lymphedema is a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling (edema). it may occur when part of the lymph system is damaged or blocked, such as during surgery to remove lymph nodes or due to radiation therapy. swelling usually develops slowly over time. it may develop during treatment or it may start years after treatment. if you have lymphedema, you may be referred to an expert in lymphedema management. the swelling may be reduced by exercise, massage, compression sleeves, and other means. ask your care team about the ways to treat lymphedema. nausea and vomiting nausea and vomiting are common side effects of treatment. you will be given medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting. neurocognitive or neuropsychological effects some treatments can damage the nervous system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with concentration, memory, and thinking. survivors are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be recommended for neuropsychological testing. neuropsychology looks at how the health of your brain affects your thinking and behavior. neuropsychological testing can identify your limits and a health care professional can create a plan to help with these limits. neuropathy neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. it usually begins in the hands or feet and gets worse over time. neuropathy may be caused by cancer or cancer treatment. most of the time, neuropathy goes away after treatment. organ issues treatment might cause your kidneys, liver, heart, and pancreas to not work as well as they should. pain tell your care team about any pain or discomfort. you might meet with a palliative care specialist or with a pain

treatment, then surgery is performed to remove the breast and lymph nodes (modified radical mastectomy) for those assigned female at birth with stage 3 cancer. this is followed by radiation to the chest wall. if you choose breast reconstruction after a mastectomy with radiation, then delayed breast reconstruction is recommended. radiation can slow the healing process. therefore, delayed reconstruction is recommended after all the healing from radiation is done. like other breast cancers, ibc can develop in those assigned male at birth. treatment for ibc starts with preoperative systemic therapy. preoperative therapy is treatment given before surgery. it is based on the expression of estrogen receptor (er) and her2 in your tumor cells. cancer can still progress during preoperative systemic therapy. order of treatments most people with cancer will receive more than one type of treatment. below is an overview of the order of treatments. 3preoperative or neoadjuvant (before) therapy is given to shrink the tumor before a primary treatment such as surgery. 3perioperative therapy is systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, given before and after surgery. 3primary treatment is the main treatment given to rid the body of cancer. 3postoperative or adjuvant (after) therapy is given after primary treatment to rid the body of any cancer cells left behind from surgery. it is also used when the risk of cancer returning (recurrence) is felt to be high. 3first-line therapy is the first set of systemic (drug) treatment given. 3second-line therapy is the next set of treatment given if cancer progresses during or after systemic therapy. talk to your care team about your treatment plan and what it means for your stage and type of cancer. 52 nccn guidelines

placed under your skin or muscle and enlarged every few weeks for two to three months. when your skin is stretched to the proper size, you will have surgery to place the final implant. implants have a small risk of leaking or causing other issues. you may feel pain from the implant or expander. scar tissue or tissue death can occur. textured implants can cause breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (bia-alcl), a type of cancer. flaps breasts can be remade using tissue from other parts of your body, known as flaps. these flaps are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh, or from under the shoulder blade. some flaps are completely removed and then sewn in place. other flaps stay attached to your body but are slid over and sewn into place. there are several risks associated with flaps, including death of fat in the flap, which can cause lumps. a hernia may result from muscle weakness. problems are more likely to occur among those who have diabetes or who smoke. implants and flaps some breasts are reconstructed with both implants and flaps. this method may give the reconstructed breast more volume to match the other breast. for any reconstruction, you may need surgery on your remaining breast to match the two breasts in size and shape. nipple replacement like your breast, a nipple can be remade. to rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use surrounding tissues. also, nipples can be remade with tissue from the thigh or the other nipple. tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to look more like a nipple. it is important to note that while you can remake something to look like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of your real nipple. also, a tattoo can be done to look like a nipple without having to take tissue from another part of the body. 61 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" what to consider what to consider some things to consider when deciding to have flat closure or reconstruction after mastectomy: +your desire -you may have a strong feeling towards flat closure or one form of reconstruction after being given the options. breast reconstruction should be a shared decision between you and your care team. make your wishes known. +health issues-you may have health issues such as diabetes or a blood disorder that might affect or delay healing, or make longer procedures unsafe. +tobacco use-smoking delays wound healing and can cause mastectomy flap death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex (nac) necrosis in a nipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. in free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk of complications. you are encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction. +breast size and shape-there are limits to the available sizes of breast implants. very large breasts or breasts that lack tone or droop (called ptosis) might be difficult to match. breast reduction surgery might be an option. +body mass index (bmi) -those with an elevated bmi have an increased risk of infections and complications with breast reconstruction. if you smoke or vape, seek help to quit smoking or vaping nicotine greatly increases your chances of having side effects during and after surgery. smoking and vaping can limit how well cancer treatment works and prevent wound healing. they also increase your chances of developing other cancers. marijuana use might also affect the amount of anesthesia used during surgery. nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes you want to keep smoking and vaping. nicotine withdrawal is challenging for most people who smoke or vape. the stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit. if you smoke or vape, ask your care team about counseling and medicines to help you quit. for online support, try these websites: smoke free. gov be tobacco free. gov cdc. gov/tobacco 62 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" key points key points +flat closure is done after a mastectomy in which the skin is tightened and sewn together without the addition of a breast implant. +breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild the shape and look of the breast. if breast construction is something you might want, delayed reconstruction is recommended in those with ibc. +breasts that are fully removed in a mastectomy can be remade with breast implants, flaps, or both. +removed nipples can be remade with body tissue and/or tattooing. when i was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer (ibc) the doctor told me to stay away from the internet, but i wanted to learn all i could. you need to learn so you can advocate for yourself. not everyone has experience treating this disease. just be sure to go to reputable sources for information. \"\"we want your feedback! our goal is to provide helpful and easy-to-understand information on cancer. take our survey to let us know what we got right and what we could do better. nccn. org/patients/feedback 63 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 20237 making treatment decisions 64 it's your choice 64 questions to ask 71 resources 64 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023making treatment decisions \" it's your choice it's important to be comfortable with the cancer treatment you choose. this choice starts with having an open and honest conversation with your care team. it's your choice in shared decision-making, you and your doctors share information, discuss the options, and agree on a treatment plan. it starts with an open and honest conversation between you and your care team. treatment decisions are very personal. what is important to you may not be important to someone else. some things that may play a role in your decision-making: +what you want and how that might differ from what others want +your religious and spiritual beliefs +your feelings about certain treatments +your feelings about pain or side effects +cost of treatment, travel to treatment centers, and time away from school or work +quality of life and length of life +how active you are and the activities that are important to you think about what you want from treatment. discuss openly the risks and benefits of specific treatments and procedures. weigh options and share concerns with your care team. if you take the time to build a relationship with your care team, it will help you feel supported when considering options and making treatment decisions. second opinion it is normal to want to start treatment as soon as possible. while cancer can't be ignored, there is time to have another doctor review your test results and suggest a treatment plan. this is called getting a second opinion, and it's a normal part of cancer care. even doctors get second opinions! things you can do to prepare: +check with your insurance company about its rules on second opinions. there may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors who are not part of your insurance plan. +make plans to have copies of all your records sent to the doctor you will see for your second opinion. support groups many people diagnosed with cancer find support groups to be helpful. support groups often include people at different stages of treatment. some people may be newly diagnosed, while others may be finished with treatment. if your hospital or community doesn't have support groups for people with cancer, check out the websites listed in this book. questions to ask possible questions to ask your doctors are listed on the following pages. feel free to use these questions or come up with your own. be clear about your goals for treatment and find out what to expect from treatment. 65 nccn

2023bone cancer basics \" the bone bone cancer includes a group of cancers that start in the bone or cartilage. this is called primary bone cancer and differs from other types of cancers that can spread or metastasize to the bone. this chapter presents an overview of bone cancer. the bone bone is a living tissue made up of collagen. collagen is the most abundant protein in the body. bone tissue also contains blood vessels, nerves, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. our body has about 206 bones. bones provide structure and support, protect our organs, create blood cells, store chemicals the body needs, and produce hormones. bone is light, yet strong and can regrow. bone is made up of the following: +compact bone or cortical bone-the hard, dense outer layer of bone that is covered by a membrane of strong connective tissue called the periosteum +spongey bone or cancellous bone-the spongy, porous inner layer of bone that contains red marrow +bone marrow-found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. there are 2 types of bone marrow: red and yellow. red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. yellow marrow is made mostly of fat. the skeletal system the human skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. it includes all of the bones and joints in the body. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" how bone is formed how bone is formed bone is a living tissue made of cells (osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts), calcium, phosphate, hydroxyapatite (a bone mineral), and collagen. new bone formation, known as ossification, starts in the womb and ends during adolescence, between 10 and 19 years of age. there are 2 forms of ossification: +compact bone (endochondral), which makes up most of the skeleton +cancellous bone (intermembranous), which includes parts of the skull, the shoulder blades, and the ends of the long bones. long bones are longer than they are wide. once ossification is complete, bone is continuously being replaced by a process called remodeling. remodeling breaks down and rebuilds bone and helps maintain normal calcium levels in the body. when calcium is needed, cells called osteoclasts break down bone. this releases calcium into the bloodstream. at the same time, bone-forming cells called osteoblasts create bone from calcium in the bloodstream. some types of bone cancer can interrupt this process. parts of bone: +epiphysis-the end of the bone, which is covered with cartilage to make a joint +metaphysis-located between the physis (growth plate) and diaphysis +diaphysis-the middle region of the bone +physis-the growth plate, which is made of cartilage. after skeletal maturity, this leaves a physeal scar or line visible in the bone anatomy of the bone the epiphysis is the end of the bone. the metaphysis is located between the physis (growth plate) and the diaphysis. the diaphysis is the middle region of the bone. 7 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" types of bone tumors 7 bone cancer basics \" types of bone tumors \" bone cancer types of bone tumors a bone tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within a bone. a bone tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). the cause of bone tumors is unknown. they often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly (the metaphysis). this book will discuss the following: +chondrosarcoma -starts in the cells that form cartilage. cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones to form a smooth surface that makes a joint. also, cartilage gives structure to the nose, ears, larynx, and other parts of the body. +chordoma -starts in notochordal cells that form the spine and vertebrae. chordomas are usually found in the lower spinal column (sacrum) or at the base of the skull. +ewing sarcoma -starts in the bone marrow and commonly occurs in the diaphysis of long bones or flat bones like the pelvis or scapula (shoulder blade). +giant cell tumor of bone (gctb)- is an overgrowth of cells found in the epiphysis. +osteosarcoma -starts in cells that form bone in the metaphysis near the growth plates. since bone cancer is very rare, many health care providers are not experts in diagnosing or treating these tumors. therefore, it is important to find a treatment center or hospital that has both experts and experience in your type of bone cancer. bone cancer cancers that start in the bone are called primary bone tumors. bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or kidney) are called secondary bone tumors or metastatic bone cancer. they behave very differently from primary bone tumors. sarcomas most primary bone cancers are sarcomas. sarcomas are a rare group of cancers. there are 2 main types of sarcomas: +soft tissue sarcomas +bone sarcomas soft tissue includes fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, blood and lymph vessels, and other supportive tissues of the body. soft tissue sarcomas are more common than bone sarcomas. bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form bone. osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common types of bone cancer. more information on soft tissue sarcomas can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 8 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" how bone cancer spreads 8 bone cancer basics \" how bone cancer spreads \" key points how bone cancer spreads unlike normal cells, cancer cells can grow or spread to form tumors in other parts of the body. this is called a metastasis. cancer can spread through blood or the lymphatic system. the lymphatic system contains a clear fluid called lymph. lymph gives cells water and food and contains white blood cells that fight germs. lymph nodes filter lymph and remove the germs. lymph travels throughout the body in vessels like blood does. lymph vessels and nodes are found everywhere in the body. although cancer can spread through your blood, you cannot spread your cancer to other people if they are exposed to your blood. bone cancer can spread to the lung or other bones. bone cancer that has metastasized to the lung is still called bone cancer. key points +bone cancer is a group of cancers that start in the bone or cartilage. this is called primary bone cancer. bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or kidney) are called secondary or metastatic bone tumors. +bone tumors may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). the cause of bone tumors is unknown. +bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form bone. most primary bone cancers are sarcomas. +osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common types of bone cancer. +bone cancer can metastasize to the lungs and other bones. +it is important to find a treatment center or hospital that has both experts and experience in your type of bone cancer. 9 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 20232

biomarker tests 20 key points 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" test results 10 testing for bone cancer \" test results \" general health tests treatment planning starts with testing. accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat primary bone cancer. a biopsy is recommended before starting treatment. this chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. test results results from imaging studies and biopsies will be used to determine your treatment plan. it is important you understand what these tests mean. ask questions and keep copies of your test results. online patient portals are a great way to access your test results. keep these things in mind: +choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment. +bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. +write down questions and take notes during appointments. don't be afraid to ask your care team questions. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. +get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. +bring all images on a compact disc (cd). you can request a disc from the hospital or center where you had your imaging. x-rays, mris, and ct scans cannot be faxed. if you are meeting a new doctor, please bring all your images on a cd. +organize your papers. create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. you can do the same on your computer. +keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. add it to your phone. hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. keep your primary care physician (pcp) informed of changes to this list. you are encouraged to keep your pcp. they are great partners in your care. +include in your contact list information on the exact type of cancer, as well as any treatment and the date it started. general health tests medical history a medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. some supplements interact and affect prescriptions that your doctor may give you. tell your doctor about any symptoms you have. a medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" general health tests family history some cancers and other diseases can run in families. your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. this information is called a family history. ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. it's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations. physical exam during a physical exam, your health care provider may: +check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate +check your height and weight +listen to your lungs and heart +look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat +feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. +feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. for possible tests, see guide 1. guide 1 possible tests: those 40 years of age and over medical history and physical exam bone scan chest x-ray blood tests such as complete blood count (cbc), comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) with calcium to assess for hypercalcemia chest/abdominal/pelvic ct with contrast biopsy, as needed, performed by orthopedic oncologist at center where you will be treated * those under 40 years of age will be referred to an orthopedic oncologist bring a list of any medications, vitamins, over-the-counter drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. 12 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" fertility (all genders) 12 testing for bone cancer \" fertility (all genders) \" preventing pregnancy fertility (all genders) treatment such as chemotherapy can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. if you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. to preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't really sure at the moment. fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. more information on fertility preservation in adolescents and young adults can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. changes in fertility treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily impaired or interrupted. this temporary loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy. preventing pregnancy preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. cancer and cancer treatment can affect the ovaries and damage sperm. hormonal birth control may or may not be recommended, so ask your doctor about options such as intrauterine devices (iuds) and barrier methods. types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. those with ovaries those who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test before starting treatment. cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby if you are or become pregnant during treatment. therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy during and after treatment is recommended. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be avoided. menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your \"period\" may stop during treatment, but often returns within 2 years after treatment in those 40 years of age and under. it is still possible to become pregnant even though you might not have a period. therefore, birth control is recommended during and after treatment. consult your doctor for the best time to plan a pregnancy. those with testicles cancer and cancer treatment can damage sperm. therefore, use contraception (birth control) such as condoms to prevent pregnancy during and immediately after cancer treatment. 13 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" performance status 13 testing for bone cancer \" performance status \" blood tests performance status performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. your state of general health will be rated using a ps scale called ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group). ps is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. your preferences about treatment are always important. the ecog ps scores range from 0 to 5. +ps 0 means the person is fully active. +ps 1 means the person is still able to perform light to moderate activity, but with some limitations. +ps 2 means the person is limited to the chair or bed less than half of the time and still able to care for self. +ps 3 means the person is limited to the chair or bed more than half of the time. +ps 4 means the person is totally confined to the bed or chair and completely unable to care for self. +ps 5 means the person is not alive. good ps is usually ps 0 or ps 1. blood tests blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. they require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into your vein. some blood tests you might have are described next. alkaline phosphatase alkaline phosphatase (alp) is an enzyme found in the blood. high levels of alp levels can be a sign of bone tumors, liver disorders, or pregnancy. a bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of alp. performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" blood tests complete blood count a complete blood count (cbc) measures the levels of red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs), and platelets (plts) in your blood. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding. comprehensive metabolic panel a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) measures 14 different substances in your blood. it is usually done on the plasma part of your blood. a cmp provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. a cmp will look for higher than normal calcium levels in your blood called hypercalcemia. calcium is the most common mineral in the body. it is needed for healthy teeth, bones, and other body tissues. bone damage from cancer can cause your bones to release calcium into the bloodstream. lactate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) or lactic acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most cells. dying cells release ldh into blood. fast-growing cells, such as tumor cells, also release ldh. pregnancy test those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins. those with bone cancer should be treated at centers experienced in this type of cancer. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" imaging tests imaging tests imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. a radiologist, who is an expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. your doctor will discuss the results with you. you will not have all of the following tests. x-ray an x-ray is a type of radiation. in small doses, it is used to make pictures of the inside of the body. it might be referred to as a radiograph. bone scan a bone scan uses a radiotracer. a radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. it can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. however, the test is quick and painless. a special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health problems. ct scan a computed tomography (ct or cat) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. it takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. all the images are combined to make one detailed picture. intravenous (iv) contrast is often used. ct machine a ct machine is large and has a tunnel in the middle. during the test, you will lie on the table that moves slowly through the tunnel. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" imaging tests contrast contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body. contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. it is used to make the pictures clearer. the contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine immediately after the test. the types of contrast vary and are different for ct and mri. tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past, especially to iodine or to shellfish such as shrimp. this is important. you might be given medicines, such as benadryl and prednisone, to avoid the effects of those allergies. contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well. mammogram a mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. the pictures are made using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. diagnostic mammograms are made with more x-rays than screening mammograms. a bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. it is used to identify any tumors, and if so, the number and size of the tumor(s). a mammogram might be needed to confirm that the cancer found in your bones is not from breast cancer. mri scan a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. it does not use x-rays. during the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. contrast might be used. a closed mri has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. an open mri has a magnet top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. most people prefer to find a location with an open mri. tell your doctor if you have any metal in your body or if you tend to have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces). you might be surprised how tight a fit it is and how confined you might feel even in an open mri. pet/ct scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. a tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow. cancer cells show up as bright spots on pet scans. however, not all tumors will appear on a pet scan. also, not all bright spots are cancer. it is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on pet. inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. when a pet scan is combined with ct, it is called a pet/ct scan. it may be done with one or two machines depending on the cancer center. a whole-body pet/ct or head-to-toe scan can be used to look for evidence of cancer throughout your body. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biopsy 17 testing for bone cancer \" biopsy \" genetic testing biopsy a biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue for testing. a diagnosis of bone cancer is confirmed using a core needle or surgical biopsy. the placement of the biopsy is critical. therefore, it is recommended that the biopsy be performed at an experienced center where you will receive treatment. +core needle biopsy removes tissue samples with a large, hollow needle that can grab a piece of tissue. this is frequently performed under light sedation by an interventional radiologist. it can also be performed by your surgeon in the office. +surgical biopsy removes a sample of the tumor through a small incision. a surgical biopsy should be performed by your treating surgeon. this requires a trip to the operating room. bone marrow tests bone marrow tests might be done in certain cases. there are 2 types of bone marrow tests that are often done at the same time: +bone marrow aspirate +bone marrow biopsy your bone marrow is like a sponge holding liquid and cells. an aspirate takes some of the liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy takes a piece of the sponge. the samples are usually taken from the back of the hip bone (pelvis). you will likely lie on your belly or side. your doctors will first clean and give sedation and/or numb your skin and outer surface of your bone. for an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed through your skin and into the bone. liquid bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe. for the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to remove a core sample. you may feel bone pain at your hip for a few days. your skin may bruise. genetic testing genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup). the goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological parents called germline mutations. some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. you can pass these genes on to your children. also, family members might carry these mutations. tell your doctor if there is a family history of cancer. there are 3 major types of genetic testing: +cytogenetic -to examine whole chromosomes +biochemical-to measure proteins produced by genes +molecular-to look for dna or gene mutations and/or gene fusions while it can be confusing, just know that testing done to look for an inherited gene mutation or an inherited risk of cancer is different than genetic testing done on cancer cells or testing to look for proteins produced by cancer cells. 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests 18 testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests \" biomarker tests biomarker tests inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) molecules. these molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome. chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell. normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. each chromosome contains thousands of genes. genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make. a mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code. a sample from your biopsy will undergo lab tests to look for specific dna mutations/ alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features. this information is used to learn more about your cancer and to choose the best treatment for you. it is sometimes called molecular testing, tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). it identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. proteins are written like this: idh1. genes are written with italics like this: idh1. when a gene or protein is found, it is shown with a plus sign (+) like this: idh1+. when a gene or protein has not been found, it is written with a negative sign (-) like this: idh1-. ewing sarcoma a cell must make a copy of its chromosomes before dividing into two cells. sometimes, there are mistakes in the copies. one type of mistake is when parts (dna) of two chromosomes break off and switch with each other. this is called a translocation. it can result in a fusion of two genes. a translocation between chromosome 11 and 22 is written as t(11;22) and is common in ewing sarcoma. ewing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion of the ews gene (ewsr1) on chromosome 22 with various members of the ets gene family (fli1, erg, etv1, etv4, and fev), with fli1 being the most common. almost everyone with ewing sarcoma will have one of the possible gene fusions. this is not inherited from your parents, but happens for some other reason. when this occurs only in cancer cells, this is called a somatic mutation or somatic change. msi-h/d mmr mutation microsatellites are short, repeated strings of dna. when errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (mmr) proteins. some cancers have dna mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. this is called microsatellite instability (msi) or deficient mismatch repair (d mmr). when cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called msi-h (microsatellite instability-high). this is often due to d mmr genes. pembrolizumab (keytruda) is an option for those with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests tumor mutational burden when there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor dna, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (tmb-h). pembrolizumab (keytruda), nivolumab (opdivo), or ipilimumab (yervoy) might be used in some cases for tmb-h tumors. tumor mutation testing a sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific mutations. in tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. idh1 mutation some mutations such as idh1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) gene mutations can be targeted with specific therapies. ivosidenib (tibsovo) is for those with chondrosarcoma who are susceptible to idh1 mutations. next-generation sequencing next-generation sequencing (ngs) is a high-throughput method used to determine the dna sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in your bone tumor. pcr a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a lab process that can make millions or billions of copies of your dna (genetic information). pcr is very sensitive. it can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. these copies are called pcr product. what is your family health history? some cancers and other diseases run in families --those who are related to you through genes passed down from parent to child. this information is called a family health history. you can ask family members about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. for relatives who have died, ask about the cause and age of death. start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. some of the questions to ask include: 3do you have any chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, or health conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol? 3have you had any other diseases, such as cancer or stroke? 3how old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? 3what is our family's ancestry--from what countries did our ancestors originate? 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone

cancer staging is used to make treatment decisions. it describes the size and location of the tumor, and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body. this chapter provides a general overview of cancer staging. overview there are many staging systems. most staging systems include information about: +where the tumor is located in the body +the cell type (such as sarcoma or carcinoma) +the size of the tumor +whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes +whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body +tumor grade, which refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look and how likely the tumor is to grow and spread tnm score the tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage most bone cancers. in this system, the letters t, n, and m describe different areas of cancer growth. based on imaging and biopsy results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. the higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has

care team treatment for bone cancer is based on the type, size, and location of the tumor. this chapter presents an overview of the types of treatment and what to expect. not everyone will receive the same treatment. care team treating bone cancer takes a team approach. treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (mdt). an mdt is a team of doctors, health care workers, and social care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience with your type of cancer. this team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. ask who will coordinate your care. some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. the mdt should meet on a regular basis and should include the following: +an orthopedic oncologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors. they treat any area of the body except the neck and skull and inside the chest and abdomen. +a medical or pediatric oncologist treats cancer using systemic (drug) therapy. +a radiation oncologist prescribes and plans radiation therapy to treat cancer. +a musculoskeletal radiologist interprets the results of x-rays and other imaging tests. +a bone pathologist interprets the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy or surgery. depending on your type of care, the team might include: +a thoracic surgeon who performs operations within the chest. +a plastic surgeon who performs operations to improve function or reconstruct missing areas. +an interventional radiologist who performs needle biopsies, ablation therapies, and embolizations, and places ports for treatment. +a physiatrist, a medical doctor who specializes in physical movement and rehabilitation. +a vascular surgeon who specializes in procedures involving arteries, veins, and lymph circulation. +a surgical oncologist or general surgeon who has specialized knowledge and experience related to the diagnosis, preoperative, operative, and postoperative care for the whole patient. +a neurosurgeon who specializes in surgery on the nervous system, especially the brain and spinal cord. 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" surgery +an orthopedic oncologist or orthopedic surgeon who focuses on the body's musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and nerves. +an orthopedic spine surgeon who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases and conditions. may be an orthopedic oncologist. your physical, mental, and emotional well-being are important. you know yourself better than anyone. help other team members understand: +how you feel +what you need +what is working and what is not keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. this will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know who to contact with questions or concerns. surgery surgery is an operation or procedure to remove cancer from the body. the type of surgery depends on size, location, and number of tumor(s). surgery can be used to: +remove all of the tumor +relieve pain or discomfort the goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer. to full remove all of the cancer, your surgeon must cut out the tumor with a rim of normal tissue around the edge. this allows the pathologist to determine a surgical margin. a clear or negative margin resection (r0) is when no cancerous cells are found in the tissue around the edge of the tumor. an r1 positive margin or r1 resection indicates the surgeon has removed all of the visible tumor, but the microscopic margins are still positive for tumor cells. in an r2 positive margin, the surgeon does not or is unable to remove all of the visible tumor. a tumor that can be removed completely with surgery is called resectable. not all tumors are resectable. you might receive treatment to shrink a tumor or the amount of cancer before surgery. this is called preoperative or neoadjuvant treatment. treatment after surgery might be referred to as postoperative or adjuvant. when preparing for surgery, seek care or ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of bone cancer. it is important to find an experienced surgeon who has performed this type of procedure many times with good results. limb-sparing resection for bone cancer in the limbs, the goal of surgery, whenever possible, is to preserve or maintain limb function. this is called limb-sparing surgery. a surgeon who is an expert in your type of bone cancer should be consulted before deciding upon surgical treatment options. rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy, will likely be part of a limb-sparing treatment plan. this may include occupational therapy to help with daily life skills or physical therapy to help your body move and function. a physiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in rehabilitation. 31 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" surgery amputation amputation is the removal of a limb or other body part. a surgeon who is an expert in your type of bone cancer should be consulted before amputation. one type of amputation is a rotationplasty. in a rotationplasty, the bottom of the femur, the knee, and the top of the tibia are removed. the lower leg is then rotated and attached to the femur. the intention of this surgery is to allow knee function when it otherwise would not be possible. rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy, will be part of any amputation. seek a peer support group to connect with others who have experienced the loss of a limb. this will aid in your recovery and help you to maintain an active lifestyle. a physiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in rehabilitation. palliative surgery surgery to ease pain or discomfort is called palliative surgery. it might be used to remove metastases that are causing pain. surgery to remove a metastasis is called a metastasectomy. this is different from a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. palliative surgery is sometimes offered to fix a broken bone or help prevent a cancerous bone from breaking. order of treatments most people with cancer will receive more than one type of treatment. below is an overview of the order of treatments. 3preoperative or neoadjuvant (before) therapy is given to shrink the tumor before a primary treatment such as surgery. 3perioperative therapy is systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, given before and after surgery. 3primary treatment is the main treatment given to rid the body of cancer. 3postoperative or adjuvant (after) therapy is given after primary treatment to rid the body of any cancer cells left behind from surgery. it is also used when the risk of cancer returning (recurrence) is felt to be high. 3definitive treatment is the best treatment after all choices have been considered. 3first-line therapy is the first set of systemic (drug) treatment given. 3second-line therapy is the next set of treatment given if cancer progresses during or after systemic therapy. talk to your care team about your treatment plan and what it means for your stage and type of cancer. 32 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" systemic therapy systemic therapy systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. each works differently. types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. systemic therapy might be used alone or with other therapies. goals of systemic therapy should be discussed before starting treatment. the choice of therapy takes into consideration many factors, including age, other serious health issues, and future treatment possibilities. your preferences about treatment are important. if you have any religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds of treatment, now would be the time to share them with your care team. warnings! you might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain food or herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. some supplements and food can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. this is called a drug interaction. it is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. some examples include: +turmeric +gingko biloba +green tea extract +st. john's wort certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. antacids, heart medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy. this is why it is important to tell your doctor about any medications, vitamins, over-the-counter (otc) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. bring a list with you to every visit. chemotherapy chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and normal cells. more than one chemotherapy drug may be used to treat your type of cancer. when only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. a combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs. some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein or injected under the skin with a needle. other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed. the final dose differs between people because it is based on body weight and height. intrathecal chemotherapy is injected into spinal or brain fluid. in most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows the body to recover before the next cycle. cycles vary in length depending on which chemotherapy is used. you will have tests to see how well treatment is working. you might spend time in the hospital during treatment. targeted therapy targeted therapy is drug therapy that focuses on specific or unique features of cancer cells. targeted therapies seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the body. these drugs stop the action of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/or survive. some targeted therapy drugs block the chemical signals that tell cancer cells to grow. other targeted therapy drugs block signals that cause new blood vessels to form. others target hormones. 33 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" radiation therapy immunotherapy immunotherapy is drug therapy that increases the activity of your immune system. by doing so, it improves your body's ability to find and destroy cancer cells. immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. radiation therapy radiation therapy (rt) uses high-energy radiation from photons, electrons, or protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. it is given over a certain period of time. radiation therapy can be given alone or with certain systemic therapies. when used as supportive care to help ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer, it is called palliative rt. radiation may be given: +as the primary (first) treatment +before surgery, called neoadjuvant rt, to shrink the tumor before surgery +after surgery, called adjuvant rt, to kill any cancerous cells that remain +as palliative treatment to ease pain or discomfort caused by bone tumors external beam radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy (ebrt) uses a machine outside of the body to aim radiation at the tumor(s). there is more than one type of ebrt used in the treatment of bone cancer. these allow for safer, higher doses of radiation. types of ebrt that may be used to treat your cancer include: +stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) uses high-energy radiation beams to treat cancers in 5 or fewer treatments. +stereotactic radiosurgery (srs) uses special equipment to position the body and give one precise, large dose of radiation. +three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3d-crt) uses computer software and ct images to aim beams that match the shape of the tumor. +intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt) uses small beams of different strengths to match the shape of the tumor. +particle beam radiation therapy uses protons, carbon ions, or other heavy ions to treat bone cancer. internal radiation internal radiation called brachytherapy is placed inside the body as a solid implant similar to beads or seeds. radiopharmaceuticals radiopharmaceuticals contain a radioactive substance that emits radiation. this radioactive substance is different than contrast material used in imaging. samarium 153-edtmp or sm153-edtmp (quadramet) is a beta-particle-emitting, bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical. it is injected into a vein and distributed throughout the body, where it is absorbed in areas where cancer has invaded the bone. 34 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" clinical trials clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase i trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. they also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful. +phase ii trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase iii trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase iv trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. take time to discuss with family, friends, or others whom you trust. keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. start the conversation don't wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. if you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the requirements. if you have already started standard treatment you may not be eligible for certain clinical trials. try not to be discouraged if you cannot join. new clinical trials are always becoming available. 35 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" clinical trials frequently asked questions there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. are clinical trials free? there is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. the study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. you may, however, have costs indirectly related to the trial, such as the cost of transportation or child care due to extra appointments. during the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. this care is billed to--and often covered by-- insurance. you are responsible for copays and any costs for this care that are not covered by your insurance. finding a clinical trial in the united states nccn cancer centers nccn. org/cancercenters the national cancer

ablation ablation uses extreme cold or extreme heat to destroy cancer cells. it can destroy small tumors with little harm to nearby tissue. there are 2 types of thermal ablation used to destroy cancer cells: +cryotherapy or cryosurgery +radiofrequency ablation (rfa) both types of ablation use a special needle, called a probe, which is inserted into the tumor. with cryotherapy, a medical gas is passed through the probe to cause below-freezing temperatures. this freezes the tumor to destroy it. with rfa, the probe emits radio waves to heat the tumor and destroy it. the probe can be guided into place with a ct scan, ultrasound, or other imaging tests. the probe will be removed when treatment is done. embolization embolization treats tumors by cutting off their blood supply. a catheter will be inserted into an artery and guided to the tumor. once in place, beads will be inserted to block the blood flow. with chemoembolization, the beads are coated with chemotherapy. radioembolization uses small radioactive beads. supportive care supportive care is health care that relieves symptoms caused by cancer or its treatment and improves quality of life. it might include pain relief (palliative care), emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or family counseling. supportive care is given during all cancer stages. tell your care team how you are feeling and about any side effects. best supportive care is used with other treatments to improve quality of life. best supportive care, supportive care, and palliative care are often used interchangeably. it is important to tell your care team about all side effects so they can be managed. 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" key points key points +treatment

is most commonly found in the thigh bone (femur), arm (humerus), or pelvis. treatment is based on the grade of the tumor and if it can be removed with surgery. a tumor that can be removed with surgery is called resectable. an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. surgery to remove all of the tumor is called wide excision. treatment is grouped as follows: +low grade and intracompartmental (intracompartmental tumor has not grown outside of the bone) +high grade (grade 2 or 3), clear cell, or extracompartmental (tumor has grown outside of the bone) +metastatic disease at initial diagnosis +dedifferentiated-treated with ewing sarcoma therapy +mesenchymal-treated with ewing sarcoma therapy treatment treatment options will be based on your wishes and your care team's recommendations. low-grade and intracompartmental chondrosarcoma a low-grade (grade 1) and intracompartmental tumor is still within the bone. it has not grown through the bone wall or spread to any other part of the body. these tumors are sometimes called atypical cartilaginous tumors. depending on the location of the tumor, treatment is intralesional excision (surgery) to remove part of the tumor. this is also called curettage. intralesional excision is not an option for pelvic tumors. after treatment you will be monitored with the following tests for the return of cancer called recurrence. +physical exam +x-rays of primary site and/or mri or ct (both with contrast) as needed every 6 to 12 months for 2 years, then yearly as needed +chest imaging every 6 to 12 months for 2

chordoma \" overview \" treatment chordoma is a slow-growing sarcoma that usually starts in the lower spinal column or at the base of the skull. it often grows into the soft tissue around the bone making it difficult to treat. treatment options include surgery or radiation therapy. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview chordomas are a type of cancerous tumor that can occur anywhere along the spine, from the base of the skull to the tailbone. these tumors grow slowly, gradually invading nearby bone and soft tissue. tumors often involve critical structures such as the brainstem, spinal cord, and important nerves and arteries. for this reason, chordomas are difficult to treat. they can also come back, or recur, after treatment--usually in the same place as the first tumor. this is called a local recurrence. in about 2 out of 5 people, the tumor eventually spreads, or metastasizes, to other parts of the body. this chapter is for conventional or chondroid chordomas. those with chordoma should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team who are experts in the management of chordoma. before starting treatment, you will have imaging tests of the main (primary) sarcoma site. for those with poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated chordoma, see information on soft tissue sarcomas at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. treatment chordomas are treated based on the location of the tumor: +tumors in the spine that include the sacrum and coccyx +tumors at or in the base of the skull a tumor that can be removed with surgery is called resectable. an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery and might be treated with radiation therapy (rt). chordomas often grown outside the bone into surrounding tissue near vital organs, veins, and arteries. parts of these tissues might also need to be removed and sewn back together. this is called resection. the goal is to remove as much of the tumor as possible. tumors in spine for tumors in the spine: +if a tumor is resectable, rt might be given before, during, or after surgery. +if a tumor is unresectable, then rt might be an option. 44 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023chordoma \" monitoring 44 chordoma \" monitoring \" recurrence tumors in skull base for tumors

a tumor is unresectable, then rt might be an option. monitoring after completing treatment, you will be monitored to watch for signs that cancer has returned called a recurrence. monitoring includes a physical exam and imaging tests for up to 10 years or as needed. recurrence when cancer returns, it is called a recurrence. treatment is based on if it the recurrence is local or metastatic. in local recurrence, cancer returns close to where the initial tumor was found. in metastatic recurrence, cancer is found in bones or other parts of the body far from the original site. treatment might include surgery, systemic therapy, or radiation therapy. these treatments might be used alone or in combination. systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. before starting systemic

group of cancers that start in the bone or soft tissue. treatment begins with chemotherapy. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview ewing sarcoma is a cancerous tumor that occurs in bone or soft tissue. soft tissue includes muscle, organs, or nerves. there are 2 types of ewing sarcoma: +ewing sarcoma of bone +ewing sarcoma of soft tissues ewing sarcoma of bone usually occurs in the thigh (femur), pelvis, and bones of the chest. however, any bone may be affected. when arising in a long bone, the diaphysis is the most common site. ewing sarcoma can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), usually to the lungs, to other bones, or to the bone marrow. testing before starting treatment, you will have imaging, blood, and other tests. treatment can alter fertility. therefore, you might be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss fertility preservation options before starting treatment. for possible tests, see guide 5.

cancer and/or family. monitoring after completing local control treatment, you will be monitored to watch for signs that cancer has returned called relapse or recurrence. monitoring includes physical exams, blood tests, and imaging scans. if ewing sarcoma relapses, treatment is chemotherapy with the possibility of more surgery or radiation therapy. disease progression when cancer does not respond or progresses after primary treatment, then local control therapy such as radiation therapy (rt) and/ or surgery might be considered to prevent the spread of cancer or to ease symptoms. if cancer continues to progress, then options include a second-line chemotherapy or best supportive care. supportive care aims to improve quality of life. for second-line systemic therapy options, see guide 7.

unpredictable disease that tends to return. treatment is needed to prevent severe bone damage. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview giant cell tumor of bone (gctb) is a rare, aggressive, non-cancerous tumor. it generally happens in adults between 20 and 40 years of age, when skeletal bone growth is complete. when viewed under a microscope, the tumor consists of many very large cells or \"giant\" cells. it is not known what causes a giant cell tumor. gctb usually develops near a joint at the end of the bone. the knee is the most common location, but it can be found in the bones of the arms and the legs. it can also affect the flat bones, such as the breastbone or pelvis. gctb has a strong tendency to return to the same location. this is called local recurrence. it may also appear in the lungs (metastasize). when possible, treatment for a giant cell tumor almost always involves surgery to remove the tumor. treatment aims to prevent damage to the bone near the affected joint. before starting treatment, you will have a biopsy to confirm diagnosis and imaging tests to see if the cancer is in one area (localized) or has spread to distant sites (metastasized). giant cell tumor of bone giant cell tumors are often found at the end of the thigh bone (femur). 55 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer,

the location of the tumor or if you have other more serious health issues, surgery might not be possible. if this is the case, see unresectable treatment options. resectable a resectable tumor can be removed with surgery. when possible, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. frequently, first-line surgery involves an intralesional excision or curettage to save normal bone and scrape out all tumor cells. sometimes, a bigger surgery (wide resection) is required to remove all bone containing the tumor. this wide resection type of surgery can require reconstruction of the bone or joint. at the time of surgery, your surgeon might use treatment like ablation or embolization to help prevent the return of the tumor. unresectable an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. it might include those with a resectable tumor, but who have other more serious health conditions that prevent surgery. treatments include: +denosumab (preferred) and/or +embolization (preferred) and/or +radiation therapy (rt) there are some risks with rt and long-term use of denosumab. you should see a dentist before starting denosumab. discuss with your care team which treatment is right for you. after treatment you will have imaging tests, such as x-rays, ct, and mri. if tests find that the tumor is now resectable, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. metastatic disease in metastatic disease, there is more than one tumor. while gctb is usually benign, it can metastasize to the lungs or other bone. for resectable tumors, you might have surgery to remove the main tumor and metastasis. for unresectable tumors, options include: +denosumab +radiation therapy +observation you should see a dentist before starting denosumab. observation is sometimes referred to as watch-and-wait. ask what this might mean for you. your preferences about treatment are always important. talk to your care team and make your wishes known. 56 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f

high-grade osteosarcoma this section is for high-grade osteosarcoma. other types of high-grade non-osteosarcoma such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (ups) of bone could also be treated the same way. treatment involves chemotherapy, then surgery, followed by more chemotherapy. systemic therapy before surgery for most, treatment starts with preoperative chemotherapy. the goal of chemotherapy is to kill the cancer cells before surgery. after chemotherapy, you will have an imaging test to restage your cancer, assess treatment response, and plan surgery. surgery or local control therapy most osteosarcomas are treated with surgery to remove all of the cancer cells in your body. mri and ct scans helps determine if the osteosarcoma can be removed with surgery. most osteosarcomas are resectable with limb-sparing surgery. this means the surgeon removes the bone containing cancer and reconstructs the limb. some osteosarcomas require amputation. rarely, the tumor is unresectable. in this case, treatment then involves radiation therapy or ablation. systemic therapy after surgery treatment after surgery is called adjuvant treatment. when no cancer is found in the surgical margin, it is called a negative margin. treatment is chemotherapy. when cancer remains in the surgical margin, it is called a positive margin. treatment might be chemotherapy, or more surgery. radiation therapy might follow surgery. metastatic disease at diagnosis this section is for those with metastatic disease at diagnosis. metastases can be found in the lungs (pulmonary), bone (skeletal), or internal organs (visceral). these are often resectable. surgery to remove a metastasis is called a metastasectomy. this is different from a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. some metastases might be treated with systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or other therapies. for example, unresectable lung metastases might be treated with ablation. if surgery is not possible, then treatment might be systemic therapy or radiation therapy. before starting systemic therapy, tumor mutational burden (tmb) and biomarker testing might be done. 61 nccn guidelines for

cancer, 2024colon cancer basics \" the colon colon cancer is common and treatable. many cancers that start in the colon can be cured, especially when found early. the colon the colon makes up most of the large intestine (bowel). in the colon water is absorbed from eaten food, turning it into feces or stool. after leaving the colon, stool moves into the rectum. the rectum is the last 6 inches or so of the large bowel. stool is held here until it leaves the body through an opening called the anus. the term colorectal cancer is used to describe cancers that form in either the colon or rectum. while these cancers are similar, their treatment is different. the focus of this guide is colon cancer. for information on rectal cancer treatment, see the nccn guidelines for patients: rectal cancer at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. the colon the start of the colon is a pouch called the cecum. sticking out from the cecum is the appendix. this skinny tube is about the size of a finger and is closed at one end. the rest of the colon has 4 main sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024colon cancer basics \" polyps 6 colon cancer basics \" polyps \" key points polyps polyps are non-cancerous growths that form on the inner lining of the colon and rectum. the most common type is called an adenoma. while it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive colon cancer. cancer that forms in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma. this is the most common type of colon cancer. polyps that rarely turn into cancer include hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps. while most polyps do not become cancer, almost all colon cancers start in a polyp. removing polyps can prevent cancer before it starts. most can be removed during a colonoscopy using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy. polyps can also be tested to make sure that cancer has not already started to develop. for more information, see the nccn guidelines for patients: colorectal cancer screening at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. key points this guide discusses the following key topics about colon cancer diagnosis and treatment. testing and treatment planning +testing the tumor for a biomarker (feature) called mismatch

key points 8 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" mismatch repair testing 8 testing and treatment planning \" mismatch repair testing \" family health history this chapter describes testing and other care needed to create your treatment plan. all colon cancers should be tested for mutations (changes) in genes that fix damaged dna, called mismatch repair (mmr) genes. most colon cancers are found during colonoscopy. it is common to have another colonoscopy to thoroughly examine the colon and look for other possible areas of cancer. this is called a diagnostic colonoscopy. mismatch repair testing mismatch repair (mmr) or microsatellite instability (msi) testing is recommended for everyone diagnosed with colon cancer. this feature of some colon cancers is a type of biomarker. biomarkers are targetable changes of a cancer that help guide your treatment. testing involves analyzing a piece of the colon tumor in a lab. depending on the method used, an abnormal result is called either microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) or mismatch repair deficient (d mmr). tumors that do not have these changes are referred to as microsatellite stable (mss) or mismatch repair proficient (p mmr). if the cancer is d mmr/msi-h, you will also be tested for an inherited condition called lynch syndrome, described next. family health history your doctor will ask about the health history of your biological (related by blood) family members. those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer are more likely to have this cancer compared to the average person. most colon cancers occur for unknown reasons. while rare, some people are born with a disorder that makes them more likely to get colon and other cancers. these are called inherited cancer syndromes. two such conditions include lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (fap). people born with lynch syndrome are at high risk of developing colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. lynch syndrome is caused by inherited mutations of the mmr genes. for cancers found to have the d mmr/msi-h biomarker, testing for lynch syndrome is recommended. fap causes hundreds to thousands of polyps to form in the colon and rectum. the polyps start as benign growths, but over time can become invasive colon cancer. cancer often develops by age 50 in people with classic fap. a milder form (attenuated fap) causes fewer polyps and usually starts later in life. if an inherited syndrome is suspected, your doctor will refer you to a genetic counselor. this expert can speak with you and your family about testing for syndromes related to colon cancer. to be tested, you must provide a sample of blood or saliva. a pathologist tests the sample for gene mutations that cause these syndromes. it is important to meet with a genetic counselor before having any genetic testing. 9 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" blood tests blood tests the following tests are not used alone to diagnose colon cancer, but abnormal results may signal health problems. complete blood count cancer and other health problems can cause low or high blood cell counts. a complete blood count (cbc) measures the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in a blood sample. white blood cells help the body to fight infection. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. platelets help wounds heal by forming blood clots. chemistry profile also known as a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp), this group of tests provides information about how well your kidneys, liver, and other organs are working. cea blood test carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) is a protein found in blood. the level of cea is often higher than normal in people with colon cancer, especially if the cancer has spread to other organs. monitoring cea can be helpful even when the cancer is only in the colon and the level is normal, because the level will rise if the cancer later spreads to other organs. however, monitoring cea is not helpful for everyone, even if the cancer has spread. people who are pregnant and those who smoke may have higher cea levels. ct dna there is growing interest in circulating tumor dna (ct dna) testing for people with early-stage colon cancer. also called a liquid biopsy, this test looks for small pieces of dna released by tumor cells into the blood. it can detect microscopic disease that may remain in the body after colectomy. this information may be helpful in predicting the risk of the cancer returning or other outcomes. but more information is needed, and at this time ct dna testing is only recommended as part of a clinical trial. i was diagnosed in the er at age 44, 58 days after my wedding, and i faced biases and unexpected challenges. i had to fight to get care because i was dismissed for more than a year for so many different reasons. my journey taught me this: never give up, explore every reasonable option, and prioritize your mental health. your life is the only one you have, so be true to yourself. before any diagnosis, put on your life jacket first--take care of yourself. get screened, know your family history. when facing colorectal cancer, the best care begins with self-care. \"\" 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" imaging imaging imaging tests can show areas of cancer inside the body. a radiologist interprets the images and conveys the results to your oncologist. your care team will tell you how to prepare for your scans. if you get nervous in tight spaces, let them know. you may be offered a type of medicine called a sedative to help you relax. ct computed tomography (ct) is the main imaging test used to see colon cancer in the body. during the scan you will lie face-up on a table that moves through a tunnel-like machine. you will be able to hear and speak with a technician at all times. a substance called contrast is used to make the pictures clearer. it is injected into your vein and mixed with a liquid to drink. you may feel flushed or get hives. some people have an allergic reaction. tell your doctor if you've had problems with contrast in the past. mri magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is not often used to plan treatment for colon cancer. your doctor may order an mri to get a better look at the liver or rectum, or if the ct scan results are unclear. getting an mri is much like getting a ct scan. in some cases, the area of the body being imaged is placed within a narrowed coil device that looks like a brace. it covers your body from below your chest to the top of your legs. it sends and receives radio waves. straps may be used to help you stay in place. an mri may cause your body to feel warm. if mri is being used to better see cancer near the rectum, an enema may be needed. or a gel may be inserted into the rectum beforehand. ct scan ct with contrast is the main imaging test used to determine the extent of colon cancer in the body. ct takes many pictures of the inside of the body using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make one detailed picture. 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" fertility and family planning fertility and family planning for unknown reasons, colon cancer is being diagnosed more often in young adults. some cancer treatments make it hard or impossible to have children. if you are interested in potentially having children in the future, tell your care team. they will discuss any fertility-related risks of your treatment plan with you. some methods for preserving (keeping) fertility before cancer treatment are described below. your doctor may refer you for counseling about fertility preservation options. sperm banking sperm banking stores semen for later use by freezing it in liquid nitrogen. the medical term for this is semen cryopreservation. egg freezing unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and stored for later use. this is called egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation. ovarian tissue banking this method involves removing part or all of an ovary and freezing the part that contains the eggs. the frozen tissue that contains the eggs can later be unfrozen and put back in the body. for more information on fertility and family planning, see the nccn guidelines for patients for adolescent and young adult cancer at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 12 nccn guidelines for

20 surveillance 21 key points 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" polyps with cancer colon cancer often forms in polyps on the lining of the colon, but can also form as lesions. this chapter explains treatment for cancer that has not spread to areas far from the colon. polyps with cancer a polyp is an overgrowth of cells on the inner lining of the colon wall. the most common type is called an adenoma. while it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive colon cancer. cancer that starts in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma. there are 2 main shapes of polyps. pedunculated polyps are shaped like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall. they have a stalk and round top. sessile polyps are flatter and do not have a stalk. a polyp in which cancer has just started to grow is called a malignant (cancerous) polyp. most polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy, using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy. colon polyps polyps are growths on the inner lining of the bowel wall. some look like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall. these are called pedunculated polyps. others are flatter and do not have a stalk. these are called sessile polyps. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer often, no further treatment is needed after a polypectomy. in other cases, surgery (resection) of a bigger piece of the colon is needed. this depends on: +the size and shape of the polyp (pedunculated or sessile), +the polypectomy results, and +the results of testing the removed tissue. before deciding whether resection is needed after a polypectomy, your doctor will review the results of testing with you and discuss your options. invasive cancer for cancers not found early enough to be removed by polypectomy, colectomy (colon surgery) is needed. surgery is only an option if the colon tumor can be completely removed. if you cannot have surgery first, see page 19. colectomy a colectomy is a surgery that removes the part of the colon with cancer. after the cancerous part is removed, the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are sewn or stapled together. at least 12 lymph nodes near the tumor will be removed and tested for cancer, in addition to any nodes that look abnormal to the surgeon. a colectomy can be done in two ways. the open method removes tumor tissue through a colectomy surgery for colon cancer is called colectomy. it involves removing the cancerous part of the colon. the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are then attached to each other. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer large cut in your abdomen. the minimally invasive method involves making a few small cuts. tools are inserted through the cuts to see and remove part of your colon. the tissue removed during surgery is sent to a pathologist. the pathologist determines how far the cancer has grown within the colon wall. they also test the removed lymph nodes for cancer. these results are used to assign the cancer a stage. the stage helps determine whether you need chemotherapy after surgery. at the time of colectomy, some people may also have a procedure called a colostomy. this is done in cases where it may not be safe to reconnect the remaining sections of colon. in a colostomy, the remaining upper part of the colon is attached to an opening on the surface of the abdomen. this opening is called a stoma. stool exits the body through the stoma and enters a bag attached to the skin. this is typically only needed for a short time. for colon cancer surgery, the colostomy can often be reversed with another operation. colostomy is also known as diversion because it diverts (redirects) the flow of stool. colostomy if the two healthy ends of the remaining colon cannot be safely reconnected after the cancer is removed, a colostomy may be performed. a colostomy connects a part of the colon to the outside of the abdomen. this creates an opening in your abdomen that allows stool to pass through. for colon cancer surgery, it is rare for a colostomy not to be reversed with another operation. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer bowel blockage in rare cases, a tumor may grow so large that it blocks the flow of stool. there are several ways to deal with a blockage. one option is a colectomy that also unblocks the bowel. this is known as a one-stage colectomy. a second option is colectomy with colostomy. this is typically only needed for a short time. another possibility is that a colostomy may be done first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer. lastly, in rare cases, a mesh metal tube called a stent may be placed first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer. the stent keeps the colon open, allowing gas and stool to pass. staging the cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body. having a general idea of the structure of the colon wall is helpful for understanding how colon cancer is staged. the colon wall is made of layers of tissue. cancer starts in the innermost layer that comes in contact with food. this layer is called the mucosa. the next layer is the submucosa. it is made of connective tissue and contains mucus glands, blood and lymph vessels, and nerves. the submucosa is followed by a layer of muscle called the muscularis propria. the outer, fourth layer is called serosa (or adventitia). if left untreated, cancer cells grow through the layers of the colon wall, towards the inside of the abdomen. the cancer can then invade structures or organs outside of the colon. cancer cells can also break off from the colon tumor and travel through lymph or blood to nearby lymph nodes. the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage colon cancer. in the ajcc system, the following key pieces of information about the cancer are used to give it a stage:your care team will give you information on: how to prepare for surgery what to expect during and after surgery recovery possible short-and long-term side effects of colectomy, including: !leaking from the spot where the colon was reconnected (anastomotic leak) !changes in bowel habits !bowel blocked by scar tissue !organs pushing through tissues or muscles weakened by surgery (hernia) 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer +t: how far the tumor has grown into or through the colon wall +n: whether any lymph nodes have cancer +m: whether the cancer has spread to areas or organs outside the colon (metastasized) the t, n, and m scores are combined to assign the cancer one of the following stages: 0, i (1), ii (2), iii (3), or iv (4). the stages are explained below. stage 0 there are abnormal cells on the innermost layer of the colon wall. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into deeper layers of the colon wall. stage 0 colon cancer is also called carcinoma in situ of the colon. stage 1 the cancer has grown into either the second or third layer of the colon wall. there is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon. stage 2 the cancer has grown into, or beyond, the fourth layer of the colon wall. there is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon. stage 3 the cancer has spread from the colon to nearby lymph nodes or there are tumor deposits. tumor deposits are small tumors in the fat around the colon. stage 4 the cancer has spread to areas outside the colon and nearby lymph nodes. colon cancer spreads most often to the liver and/or lungs. if you can't have surgery first having surgery first is not always an option. it may not be possible because of the location of the tumor, or because of other health problems. in this case, systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) is given first. systemic therapy may also be given first for advanced cancers, or cancer that has spread to lymph nodes. if this approach is planned, chemotherapy is recommended for p mmr/mss cancers. immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor is preferred for d mmr/msi-h cancers. immunotherapy increases the activity of your immune system, improving your body's ability to find and destroy cancer cells. checkpoint inhibitors recommended for use before colectomy in d mmr/msi-h cancers include: +pembrolizumab (keytruda) +nivolumab (opdivo) with or without ipilimumab (yervoy) sometimes radiation therapy (alone or with chemotherapy) is given along with systemic therapy for unresectable cancers. for more information on the side effects of checkpoint inhibitors, see the nccn guidelines for patients: immunotherapy side effects: immune checkpoint inhibitors at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" chemotherapy after surgery chemotherapy after surgery chemotherapy is the use of medicine to kill cancer cells. it is a type of systemic therapy. chemotherapy is usually given intravenously. this means the medicine is slowly infused into the bloodstream through a vein. it travels through the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body. chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows your body to recover between cycles. cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. stage 1 chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 1 cancers. stage 2 chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 2a and 2b d mmr/msi-h cancers, but may be given for some stage 2c d mmr/msi-h cancers. chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for some stage 2 p mmr/mss cancers. it is most helpful for cancers with a high risk of recurrence (returning after treatment). your doctor will consider the features and risk factors of the cancer to determine if recurrence is likely. if chemotherapy is planned, recommended regimens include capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)/leucovorin. these are given for 6 months. folfox and capeox are recommended options for high-risk cancers. folfox is given for 6 months; capeox for 3 months. stage 3 chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for all stage 3 colon cancers. preferred regimens include capeox and folfox. other recommended options include capecitabine and 5-fu. chemotherapy is typically given for 3 to 6 months. the length of treatment depends on the regimen and the risk of recurrence. side effects systemic therapy kills both cancer cells and healthy cells. the damage to healthy cells can cause hair loss, cracked skin, mouth sores, and other side effects. managing side effects is a shared effort between you and your care team. it is important to speak up about bothersome side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. ask about your options for managing or relieving the effects of treatment. more information on supportive care is available at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" surveillance surveillance follow-up testing is started when there are no signs of cancer after treatment. it can help find new cancer growth early. stage 1 a colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery for stage 1 cancers. if the results are normal, your next colonoscopy should be in 3 years, and then every 5 years. if a concerning or high-risk adenoma is found, your next colonoscopy will be needed within 1 year. if you don't have any symptoms, other testing is not needed on a regular basis. imaging tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the cancer may have come back or spread. stages 2 and 3 in addition to colonoscopy, surveillance for stages 2 and 3 colon cancer includes physical exams, carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood tests, and ct scans. the recommended schedule for surveillance testing is shown in guide 1. in addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. for more information, see chapter 5: survivorship. guide 1 stages 2 and 3-surveillance after treatment physical exam and cea blood test first 2 years: every 3 to 6 months next 3 years: every 6 months ct of chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 to 12 months for 5 years colonoscopy you did not have a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 3 to 6 months after surgery. you had a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery. if no advanced adenomas are found, repeat in 3 years. after that, repeat every 5 years. 21 nccn guidelines for

23 treatment for metastatic cancer \" biomarker testing \" local therapies colon cancer spreads most often to the liver, sometimes to the lungs, and less often to the abdomen or other areas. cancer that has metastasized by the time it is diagnosed is stage 4. biomarker testing biomarkers are targetable features of a cancer. they are often mutations (changes) in particular genes. when possible, biomarker testing is performed on a piece of tumor tissue removed during a biopsy or surgery. if this isn't possible, a sample of blood can be tested. all metastatic colon cancers should be tested for the following biomarkers: +mismatch repair deficiency/high microsatellite instability (d mmr/msi-h) (if not already performed) +ras (kras and nras ) mutations +braf mutations +her2 amplification testing for many biomarkers at one time is called next-generation sequencing (ngs). ngs can find other, rare biomarkers for which targeted treatments may be available, including: +pole/pold1 mutations +ret fusions +ntrk fusions local therapies your treatment options may include local therapies. these are treatments that target liver and lung tumors directly. some are interventional oncology/radiology techniques, also known as image-guided therapies. these techniques use imaging, such as ultrasound or computed tomography (ct), to deliver minimally invasive cancer treatments. using imaging during the procedure allows your doctor to precisely target the tumor(s). a team of experts can determine the best local therapy for your metastatic tumor(s). to learn if surgery or treatment with other local therapies is an option, your case should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of experts. the team should include a surgeon experienced in removing liver and lung tumors and an interventional oncologist/radiologist. resection surgery to remove liver and/or lung tumors is called resection. resection is often preferred for removing colon cancer that has spread to these organs. image-guided thermal ablation (described on the next page) may be used: +with resection, if surgery is not expected to completely remove the tumors +instead of resection, if the tumors are small and can be completely destroyed if a liver resection is needed, your liver may need to be enlarged first. this is done using a minimally invasive procedure called portal 24 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" local therapies vein embolization. an interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into certain veins in the liver. this blocks the blood vessel to the liver tumor, causing the healthy part of the liver to grow. ablation image-guided thermal ablation destroys small liver or lung tumors. a specialized needle is placed directly into or next to the target tumor. this probe delivers targeted energy to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissue. radiofrequency and microwave ablation are commonly used methods that kill cancer cells using heat. cold energy (cryoablation) is used sometimes, mostly for lung tumors. less common types include irreversible electroporation (\"nanoknife\") and laser ablation. thermal ablation may be used in addition to surgery, or alone for small tumors that can be fully removed. it will only be used if all visible areas of cancer can be destroyed. ablation may be performed by either an interventional radiologist or a surgeon. sometimes it can be done in a single session in the interventional radiology department. liver-directed therapies embolization if the cancer has spread only (or mainly) to the liver, treatment with intra-arterial liver-directed therapies may be an option. these therapies may be considered for liver tumors that: +didn't improve (or stopped improving) with chemotherapy, and +cannot be resected or ablated. intra-arterial therapies treat liver tumors with chemotherapy beads (chemoembolization) or radioactive spheres (radioembolization). if radiation spheres are used, it is known as selective internal radiation therapy (sirt) or transarterial hepatic radioembolization (tare). these procedures are performed by interventional oncologists/radiologists. a catheter is inserted into an artery in your leg or wrist and guided to the liver tumor(s). once in place, the spheres or beads are injected into the blood vessel leading to the tumor. they collect inside the tumor and deliver radiation or chemotherapy, causing the cancer cells to die. the chemotherapy beads can also work to starve the tumor by stopping its blood supply. the chemotherapy or radiation further damage the cancer cells and cause the tumor to shrink. when embolization with chemotherapy is not an option, small beads may be used to physically block blood supply to the tumor. this is called bland embolization. haic hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (haic) is chemotherapy given directly to the liver. it is often given in addition to standard intravenous chemotherapy. using a port or pump that is 25 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" local therapies usually placed during surgery to remove liver tumors, the drugs are funneled directly into the artery leading to the liver. haic should only be performed by medical oncologists at treatment centers with experience in this method. stereotactic body radiation therapy stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) is a highly specialized type of external beam radiation therapy (ebrt). it may be used to treat colon cancer that has spread to the liver, lungs, or bone. in sbrt, high doses of radiation are delivered to metastatic tumor(s) using very precise beams. the radiation comes from a large machine outside the body. the radiation passes through skin and other tissue to reach the tumor(s). treatment with sbrt is typically complete in 5 or fewer sessions, called fractions. stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) sbrt may be used to treat colon cancer that has spread to the liver, lungs, or bone. high doses of radiation are delivered to a metastatic site or sites using very precise beams. treatment is typically given in 5 or fewer sessions. 26 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs when possible, surgery and systemic therapy is the recommended treatment approach for these cancers. the choice of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) depends on the mismatch repair (mmr) status of the cancer. surgery involves colectomy to remove the colon tumor. the liver or lung tumors are resected when the colectomy is performed, or later as a separate surgery. if the metastatic tumors are small, removing or destroying them with local therapies may be an option--alone or with surgery. p mmr/mss cancer your doctor may recommend 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy before, after, or between surgeries. this is in addition to the chemotherapy that is recommended for everyone after surgery, called adjuvant chemotherapy. the goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to kill any cancer cells that may remain in the body. either folfox or capeox is preferred. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. after chemotherapy, surveillance begins. if all areas of cancer cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies, stage 4 colon cancer is treated with systemic therapy. systemic therapy given first is called first-line therapy. recommended first-line regimens are listed below. the targeted therapy bevacizumab (avastin) may be added to any of these regimens: +folfiri +folfox +capeox +folfirinox for some p mmr/mss cancers, folfiri or folfox may be given with a targeted therapy--either panitumumab (vectibix) or cetuximab (erbitux). these regimens are only recommended for tumors without ras (kras or nras) or braf mutations. while uncommon, systemic therapy may shrink the tumors enough to be removed with surgery and/or local therapies. after surgery, most people will have more systemic therapy. in some cases, observation or a short course of chemotherapy may be possible. if the tumors do not become resectable during first-line therapy, systemic therapy is typically continued. the goal is to slow the growth and spread of the cancer. if the cancer progresses, the regimen you receive next may be different from what you had before. the choice will depend on prior systemic therapy you've had and how well you are expected to tolerate certain regimens. another important factor is whether the tumor has any biomarkers. regimens targeting specific biomarkers are listed in guide 2 on the next page. 27 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs if the cancer progresses through all available regimens, recommended options if you are eligible include: +targeted therapy with fruquintinib (fruzaqla) +chemotherapy with trifluridine and tipiracil (lonsurf) +targeted therapy with regorafenib (stivarga) all are tablets taken by mouth. the targeted therapy bevacizumab may be given with lonsurf. d mmr/msi-h or pole/pold1-mutated cancer the preferred treatment approach for resectable stage 4 d mmr/msi-h or pole/ pold1-mutated cancers is immunotherapy followed by surgery. immunotherapy is only recommended if you haven't already had treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. recommended options include: +nivolumab (opdivo), which may be given with ipilimumab (yervoy) +pembrolizumab (keytruda) +dostarlimab-gxly (jemperli) guide 2 biomarker-based treatments for p mmr/mss cancers braf v600e mutation

guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the abdomen another recommended treatment approach for these cancers is surgery followed by chemotherapy. either folfox or capeox is preferred. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. if all areas of cancer cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies, stage 4 colon cancer is treated with systemic therapy. if you are a candidate and haven't had immunotherapy, treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is recommended. your doctor will check the extent of the cancer every 2 to 3 months. surgery may become possible. or you may continue immunotherapy or switch to a different systemic therapy. if you've already had immunotherapy, another type of systemic therapy is recommended. stage 4 cancer in the abdomen some people with metastatic colon cancer will also form tumors in the layer of tissue that lines the abdomen, called the peritoneum. the peritoneum covers most of the abdominal organs. in most cases, systemic therapy is given with the goal of relieving or preventing symptoms. the regimen you receive will depend on whether the tumor has any biomarkers and how well you are expected to tolerate certain systemic therapies. tumors growing in or around the bowel can block stool from moving and leaving the body. in this case, the bowel needs to be unblocked before starting systemic therapy. this is done using one of several surgical techniques, or with a mesh metal tube called a stent. cytoreductive surgery and hipec in a small number of people, cytoreductive surgery and/or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) may be treatment options. but research is needed on whether the benefits of these treatments outweigh the possible harms. they are only used in specialized centers and under certain circumstances. cytoreductive surgery involves surgically removing all visible tumors. if the tumor cannot be separated from the surface of an organ, the organ may also need to be removed. in hipec, a heated chemotherapy solution is put directly into the abdominal cavity through small tubes called catheters. 29 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" surveillance surveillance surveillance after treatment for stage 4 colon cancer includes: +colonoscopies +physical exams +carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood tests +computed tomography (ct) scans the recommended schedule for surveillance testing is shown in guide 3. in addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. for more information, see chapter 5: survivorship. guide 3 surveillance after treatment for stage 4 colon cancer physical exam and cea blood test first 2 years: every 3 to 6 months next 3 years: every 6 months ct of chest, abdomen, and pelvis first 2 years: every 3 to 6 months next 3 years: every 6 to 12 months colonoscopy you did not have a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 3 to 6 months after surgery. you had a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery. if no advanced adenomas are found, repeat in 3 years. after that, repeat every 5 years. it's ok to have bad days but don't let yourself stay there. a positive attitude goes a long way. \"\" 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" distant recurrence distant recurrence after treatment for non-metastatic colon cancer, the cancer may return and spread to the liver, lungs, or other areas. this is called a distant recurrence. treatment with surgery and/or local therapies is recommended if all of the tumors can be totally removed. but, this is uncommon, and most distant recurrences are treated with systemic therapy. systemic therapy may shrink the tumors enough to be removed with surgery. if your doctor thinks this might be possible, the size of the tumors will be checked about every 2 months during systemic therapy. if the cancer does not become resectable, systemic therapy is typically continued. the goal is to slow the growth and spread of the cancer. specific recommendations are provided below according to the mismatch repair status of the cancer and whether resection is possible. unresectable p mmr/mss cancer if you've had recent treatment with folfox or capeox, you should not have more chemotherapy that includes oxaliplatin. oxaliplatin can cause serious nerve damage. your options for systemic therapy will depend, in part, on whether the cancer has any biomarkers. therapies targeting the biomarkers listed below are available: +her2 amplification +kras g12c mutation +braf mutations +ntrk gene fusion +ret gene fusion for cancers without biomarkers, chemotherapy with folfiri or irinotecan is a recommended first-line option. a biologic may be given with chemotherapy. biologics include bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, ramucirumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab. resectable p mmr/mss cancer if you have received treatment with chemotherapy, one recommended option is resection (and/or treatment with local therapies) first, followed by either chemotherapy or observation. observation is preferred for those who have already had treatment with oxaliplatin. a second option is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection (and/or treatment with local therapies). more chemotherapy may follow. if you have not had any chemotherapy, resection (and/or treatment with local therapies) is often performed first, followed by chemotherapy. folfox and capeox are preferred for chemotherapy. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. a second option for those who haven't had any chemotherapy is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection and/or treatment with local therapies. more chemotherapy may follow. 31 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" distant recurrence unresectable d mmr/msi-h or pole/pold1-mutated cancer if you are a candidate and haven't had immunotherapy, treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is recommended. your doctor will check the extent of the cancer every 2 to 3 months. surgery may become possible. or, you may continue immunotherapy or switch to a different systemic therapy. if you've already had immunotherapy, another type of systemic therapy is recommended. this may be oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy such as folfox or capeox. or, if the cancer has any other biomarkers, targeted therapy may be an option. resectable d mmr/msi-h or pole/ pold1-mutated cancer there are 2 options for treating resectable, distant recurrences of d mmr/msi-h cancer. local therapies may be used together with resection, or used alone for very small tumors. if you have not had immunotherapy, recommended options include: +immunotherapy, followed by observation or resection +resection followed by chemotherapy if you have received checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, one recommended option is resection first, followed by either chemotherapy or observation. observation is recommended for those who have already had treatment with oxaliplatin. a second option is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection. more chemotherapy may follow. supportive care is available for everyone with cancer. it isn't meant to treat the cancer, but rather to help with symptoms and make you more comfortable. 32 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" clinical trials clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase 1 trials study the safety and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. +phase 2 trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase 3 trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase 4 trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. take time to discuss with family, friends, or others whom you trust. keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. start the conversation don't wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. if you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the requirements. try not to be discouraged if you cannot join. new clinical trials are always becoming available. 33 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" clinical trials frequently asked questions there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard

points biomarker testing +everyone with metastatic colon cancer should have biomarker tumor testing that includes d mmr/msi-h (if not already done), ras and braf mutations, and her2 amplification. +next-generation sequencing (ngs) can find other rare biomarkers for which targeted treatments may be available, including: pole/pold1 mutations; ret fusions; and ntrk fusions. local therapies for liver and lung tumors +treatment options for metastatic colon cancer may include local therapies, such as image-guided thermal ablation and stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt). +these treatments may be used in addition to or in place of surgery if all areas of cancer can be removed. +to learn if surgery or treatment with other local therapies is an option, your case should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of experts. stage 4 colon cancer +when possible, treatment with surgery and systemic therapy is recommended. the choice of chemotherapy or immunotherapy depends on the mismatch repair status of the cancer. +stage 4 cancer that cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies is treated with systemic therapy. +for colon cancer that has spread to the peritoneum, systemic therapy is usually given. the goal is to relieve or prevent symptoms. distant recurrence +the return and spread of stage 1, 2, or 3 colon cancer to areas far from the colon is called a distant recurrence. +most distant recurrences are treated with systemic therapy. clinical trials +clinical trials provide access to investigational treatments that may, in time, be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). as the care partner for my stage iv husband, i would share that you must advocate for them. however, be respectful of their feelings and ensure you're communicating your research/questions with them. i always reviewed my list of questions and concerns with my husband on the way to our appointments in case i had something on my list that he might not

effects survivorship focuses on the physical, emotional, and financial issues faced by cancer survivors. managing the long-term side effects of cancer and its treatment, staying connected with your primary care doctor, and living a healthy lifestyle are important parts of survivorship. your primary care doctor after finishing cancer treatment, your primary care doctor will play an important role in your care. your oncologist (cancer doctor) and primary care physician (pcp) should work together to make sure you get the follow-up care you need. ask your oncologist for a written survivorship care plan. ideally, the plan will include: +a summary of your cancer treatment history +a description of possible late-and long-term side effects +recommendations for monitoring for the return of cancer +information on when your care will be transferred to your pcp +clear roles and responsibilities for your cancer doctor and your pcp +recommendations on your overall health and well-being help with side effects colon cancer survivors may experience both short-and long-term health effects of cancer and its treatment. the effects depend in part on the treatment(s) received. surgery, anti-cancer medicines, and radiation therapy all have unique potential side effects. diarrhea or incontinence colon surgery can cause changes to your bowel habits. you may experience changes in the frequency or urgency of your bowel movements. diarrhea refers to having frequent and watery bowel movements. incontinence is the inability to control urination (urinary incontinence) or bowel movements (fecal incontinence). the following may help with these side effects: +anti-diarrhea medicines +changing your diet +strengthening your pelvic floor +wearing protective undergarments nerve damage the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin can damage nerves in your fingers and toes. symptoms include numbness, cramping, tingling, or pain in these areas. acupuncture and heat may help. if you have painful nerve damage, a drug called duloxetine (cymbalta) may help. ostomy care if you have an ostomy, you may want to join an ostomy support group. another option is to 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024survivorship \" paying for care see a health care provider that specializes in ostomy care, such as an ostomy nurse. people with ostomies can still live very active lifestyles. however, it's a good idea to talk to an ostomy professional before doing any intense physical activity. paying for care cancer survivors face a unique financial burden. paying for doctor visits, tests, and treatments can become unmanageable, especially for those with little or no health insurance. you may also have costs not directly related to treatment, such as travel expenses and the cost of childcare or missed work. the term financial toxicity is used to describe the problems patients face related to the cost of medical care. financial toxicity can affect your quality of life and access to needed health care. if you need help paying for your cancer care, financial assistance may be available. talk with a patient navigator, your treatment team's social worker, and your hospital's financial services department. some of the resources listed on page 46 contain helpful information on paying for cancer care. i am a stage iii colon cancer survivor. i would recommend taking it one day at a time, 1 hour if necessary. get a second opinion to feel confident in your treatment plan. lastly, connect with others who have been where you are. peer support

important to keep up with other aspects of your health after cancer treatment. steps you can take to help prevent other health problems and to improve your quality of life are described next. cancer screening and other care get screened for other types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, and skin cancer. your primary care doctor can advise you on which screening tests you should have based on your age and risk level. other health care get other recommended health care for your age, such as blood pressure screening, hepatitis c screening, and immunizations (like the flu shot). diet and exercise try to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week. alcohol may increase the risk of certain cancers. drink little to no alcohol. a low glycemic load (gl) diet may help prevent the return of colon cancer. low gl foods cause a slower and smaller rise in blood sugar levels compared to other carbohydrate-containing foods. talk to your doctor about a low glycemic load diet. aspirin talk to your doctor about the possible risks and benefits of long-term aspirin therapy to help prevent the return of colorectal cancers. quit smoking if you smoke or vape, quit! your doctor will be able to provide (or refer you for) counseling on how to stop smoking. experts recommend eating a diet that includes a lot of plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. 39 nccn guidelines

procedures. weigh options and share concerns with your care team. if you take the time to build a relationship with your care team, it will help you feel supported when considering options and making treatment decisions. second opinion it is normal to want to start treatment as soon as possible. while cancer can't be ignored, there is time to have another doctor review your test results and suggest a treatment plan. this is called getting a second opinion, and it's a normal part of cancer care. even doctors get second opinions! things you can do to prepare: +check with your insurance company about its rules on second opinions. there may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors who are not part of your insurance plan. +make plans to have copies of all your records sent to the doctor you will see for your second opinion. support groups many people diagnosed with cancer find support groups to be helpful. support groups often include people at different stages of treatment. some people may be newly diagnosed, while others may be finished with treatment. if your hospital or community doesn't have support groups for people with cancer, check out the websites listed in this

aggressive cancer where cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. this causes the breast to look red and swollen and feel warm to the touch. the breast the breast is an organ and a gland found on the chest. the breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue. behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs. muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place. breast tissue contains glands that can make milk. these milk glands are called lobules. lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple. the ring of darker breast skin is called the areola. the raised tip within the areola is called the nipple. the nipple-areola complex (nac) is a term that refers to both parts. lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food. it also helps to fight germs. lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla). nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (alns) invasive ductal carcinoma most inflammatory breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer basics \" breast cancer 6 breast cancer basics \" breast cancer \" inflammatory breast cancer breast cancer breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast. almost all breast cancers are a subtype called carcinomas. carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body. there are different types of breast carcinoma. the most common types are either ductal or lobular. +ductal carcinoma starts in the cells that line the milk ducts. milk ducts are thin tubes that carry milk from the lobules of the breast to the nipple. it is the most common type of breast cancer. +lobular carcinoma starts in the lobules (milk glands) of the breast. it is the second most common type of breast cancer. inflammatory breast cancer most inflammatory breast cancers (ibcs) are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. it's important not to dismiss any strange skin changes to the breast, including redness, swollen nipple area, or warmth to the touch. seek medical attention right away. possible signs of ibc: +peau d'orange (pitted or dimpled appearance of skin) +skin thickening (skin has an orange-peel texture) +edema (swelling caused by excess fluid in body tissue) +erythema (reddening of the skin, usually in patches) inflammatory breast cancer in inflammatory breast cancer (ibc),

patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" test results treatment planning starts with testing. this chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. ibc can be difficult to diagnose. often, there is no lump that can be felt during a breast exam or seen on a mammogram. since there is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema) of the breast, ibc can look like an infection and therefore be difficult to diagnose. often, a biopsy of the affected skin is done to diagnose the tumor. test results you will have blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to stage the cancer. the biopsy sample will be tested for hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and her2 receptors. treatment will be based on these findings. it is important you understand what these tests mean. ask questions and keep copies of your test results. online patient portals are a great way to access your test results. keep these things in mind: +choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment. +bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. +write down questions and take notes during appointments. don't be afraid to ask your care team questions. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. +get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. +organize your papers. create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. you can do the same on your computer. +keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. add it to your phone. hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. keep your primary care physician (pcp) informed of changes to this list. +include in your contact list information on the exact type of cancer, as well as any treatments and the date they started. for possible tests, see guide 1. 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" general health tests general health tests medical history a medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (otc) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. some supplements interact and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. tell your care team about any symptoms you have. a medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. family history some cancers and other diseases can run in families. your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. this information is called a family history. ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. it's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing. guide 1 possible tests medical history and physical exam (h&p) by multidisciplinary team. medical photographs will also be taken. complete blood count (cbc), comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp)

breathing rate +check your height and weight +listen to your lungs and heart +look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat +feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. +examine your breasts to look for lumps, nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin changes. +feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. clinical breast exam clinical breast exam (cbe) is a physical exam of the bare breast performed by a health care provider to check for lumps or other changes. it is done while you are seated and/or lying down. your provider should take time to palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the armpit. a nurse or assistant might also be in the room during the exam. create a medical binder a medical binder or notebook is a great way to organize all of your records in one place. 3make copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about your specific type of cancer. it will be helpful when getting a second opinion. 3choose a binder that meets your needs. consider a zipper pocket to include a pen, small calendar, and insurance cards. 3create folders for insurance forms, test types (ie, blood, imaging, pathology, radiology, genetics), treatments, and procedures. organize items in the folder by date. 3use online patient portals to view your test results and other records.

guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" fertility (all genders) 12 testing for ibc \" fertility (all genders) \" preventing pregnancy during treatment fertility (all genders) treatment such as chemotherapy can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. if you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. to preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't really sure at the moment. fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. more information on fertility preservation in adolescents and young adults can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. changes in fertility treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily or permanently impaired or interrupted. this loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy. preventing pregnancy during treatment preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. cancer and cancer treatment can affect the ovaries and damage sperm. hormonal birth control may or may not be recommended, so ask your doctor about options such as intrauterine devices (iuds) and barrier methods. types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. those with ovaries those who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test before starting treatment. cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby if you are or become pregnant during treatment. therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy during and after treatment is recommended. non-hormonal birth control methods (barrier methods, iuds) are preferred after a breast cancer diagnosis. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be avoided. menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your \"period\" may stop during treatment, but often returns within 2 years after treatment in those 35 years of age and under. it is still possible to become pregnant even though you might not have a period. therefore, birth control is recommended during and after treatment. consult your doctor for the best time to plan a pregnancy. those with testicles cancer and cancer treatment can damage sperm. therefore, use contraception (birth control) such as condoms and iuds to prevent 13 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" blood tests pregnancy during and immediately after cancer treatment. blood tests blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. they require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into your vein. some blood tests you might have are described next. alkaline phosphatase alkaline phosphatase (alp) is an enzyme found in the blood. high levels of alp can be a sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. a bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of alp. complete blood count a complete blood count (cbc) measures the levels of red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs), and platelets (plts) in your blood. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding. comprehensive metabolic panel a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) measures 14 different substances in your blood. it is usually done on the plasma part of your blood. a cmp provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. liver function tests liver function tests (lfts) look at the health of your liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or that cancer has spread to the liver. pregnancy test those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist before starting treatment. 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests imaging tests imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. a radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. the doctor will discuss the results with you. while these reports are available to you through your patient portal, please wait to discuss these results with the doctor. the following imaging tests are not in order of importance. you will not have all of these tests. bone scan a bone scan uses a radiotracer. a radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. it can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. however, the test is quick and painless. a special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health issues. bone x-ray an x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one picture at a time. a tumor changes the way radiation is absorbed and will show up on the x-ray. x-rays are also good at showing bone issues. your care team may order x-rays if your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone scan. diagnostic mammogram a mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. the pictures are made using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. a bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. mammogram results are used to plan treatment. diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen on screening mammograms. they are used to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s). diagnostic mammograms include extra compression in certain areas of the breast, magnification views, or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast. other tests may include a breast mri or ultrasound. mri scan a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. it does not use x-rays. because of the very strong magnets used in the mri machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body. during the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. contrast is often used. a closed mri has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. an open mri has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. closed mris are more common than open mris, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests breast mri if needed, a breast mri will be used in addition to a mammogram. contrast should be used. you will be positioned face down in the machine with your arms above your head. spine and brain mri an mri can be used to detect breast cancer that has spread (metastasize) to your spine or brain. for a brain mri, a device is placed around your head. for a spine mri, no device is worn. contrast should be used in an mri. ct scan a computed tomography (ct or cat) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. it takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. all the images are combined to make one detailed picture. intravenous (iv) contrast is often used. contrast material contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body. contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. it is used to make the pictures clearer. the contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine immediately after the test. the types of contrast vary and are different for ct and mri. tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past, especially to iodine or to shellfish such as shrimp. this is important. you might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies. contrast what's the difference between a screening and diagnostic mammogram? a mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast made using x-rays. during a mammogram, the breast is pressed between two plates while you stand in different positions. multiple x-rays will be taken. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. screening mammograms are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. results take a few days. diagnostic mammograms are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or whose breasts have changed shape or size. diagnostic mammograms are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram. a radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away. both types of mammograms use low-dose x-rays to examine the breast. they may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2d) digital mammography or 3-dimensional (3d) mammograms known as tomosynthesis. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well. pet scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. a tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow. cancer cells show up as bright spots on pet scans. however, not all tumors will appear on a pet scan. also, not all bright spots are cancer. it is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on pet. inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. when a pet scan is combined with ct, it is called a pet-ct scan. it may be done with one or two machines depending on the cancer center. sodium fluoride pet-ct a sodium fluoride pet-ct might be used instead of a bone scan. in this test, the radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride. fdg pet-ct an fdg pet-ct uses a radiotracer called f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg). it is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose. you cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan. this scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear. it may help find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites. if it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride pet-ct may not be needed. fdg pet-ct can be done at the same time as a ct used for diagnosis. fes pet-ct fes is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen. it might be used instead of fdg pet-ct when cancer is estrogen receptor-positive (er+). ultrasound an ultrasound (us) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body. this is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy. a wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your bare breast using gel. it may also be placed below your armpit. ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed. ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that are near the skin. sometimes, a breast ultrasound or mri is used to guide a biopsy. inflammatory breast cancer can be difficult to diagnose. ask for a referral to a breast specialist, if possible. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy biopsy a biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample of tissue or fluid. the sample is sent to a lab for testing. a pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment. there are different types of biopsies. some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as mammogram, ultrasound, or mri. the primary or main tumor is biopsied first. other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. you may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both. types of possible biopsies include: +fine-needle aspiration (fna) or core biopsy (cb) uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. in a vacuum-assisted core biopsy (vacb), suction is used to remove the sample with a special vacuum device. +incisional biopsy removes a small amount of tissue through a cut in the skin or body. +excisional biopsy removes the entire abnormal area. this is not the preferred type of biopsy but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don't match the expected findings. +skin biopsy takes a small sample of inflamed skin on the breast. before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine. a core needle biopsy (cnb) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast. the samples are small. biopsy in a biopsy, a sample of tumor is removed. there are different types of biopsy. this image shows an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy the needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging. when mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy. one or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy. the clips are small, painless, and made of metal. they will mark the site for future treatment and imaging. the clips will stay in place until surgery. if the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. the clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time. you will be able to go through airport security and have an mri. there are both physical and emotional experiences in having biopsies. you may need to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy area after the procedure. if you are working or have other commitments, you may want to take the day off to recover emotionally and physically from the experience. axillary lymph node needle biopsy an axillary lymph node (aln) drains lymph fluid from the breast and nearby areas. in an axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with a needle. this is to determine if abnormal lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain cancer cells. an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (us-fna) or core biopsy will be used. if cancer is found, it is called node positive (node+). a marker may be placed in the node so that it can be identified later if needed. standard of care is the best known way to treat particular disease based on past clinical trials. there may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care. ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy sentinel lymph node biopsy a sentinel lymph node (sln) is the first lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node. removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb or snb). this procedure is done during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. the lymph nodes removed are called the sentinel nodes. they may or may not contain any cancer cells. just because these nodes are removed, it does not mean that they are positive for cancer. to find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive material and other dyes are injected into the area where breast tumor is located. from here, the dye travels through the lymphatics in the breast to the lymph nodes. this helps the surgeon find which of the nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes. once the nodes are found, those containing the radioactive material or dye are removed and tested by a pathologist. if cancer is found, then more than the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed. skin biopsy a sample of inflamed skin on the breast will likely be removed to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer. biopsy results histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under a microscope. it is used to make treatment decisions. your pathology report will contain information about histology. you may be recommended to have an open biopsy (surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor to confirm histology. talk to your health care provider for more information on next steps. 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" hormone receptor status hormone receptor status a hormone is a substance made by a gland in your body. your blood carries hormones throughout your body. a receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell. substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors. this causes changes within the cell. hormones recognize and bind to specific hormone receptors. when hormones attach to receptors on breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow. if found, these receptors may be targeted using endocrine therapy. there are 2 types of hormone receptors: +estrogen-plays a role in breast development +progesterone-plays a role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy hormone receptor (hr) testing should be done on any new tumors. a biopsy sample will be used. hormone receptor-positive in hormone receptor-positive (hr+) breast cancer, ihc finds estrogen and/or progesterone hormone receptors. most breast cancers are hr+. +estrogen receptor (er) is stimulated by estrogen and provides survival and proliferation (rapid growth) signals. cancer cells deprived of estrogen or which have their er signal blocked with treatment may stop growing or die. +progesterone receptor (pr) binds progesterone and also provides survival and proliferation signals. it is thought that pr expression also suggests the tumor is estrogen dependent. hr+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor signaling. hormone receptor-negative hormone receptor-negative (hr-) breast cancer cells do not have either estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors. these cancers are sometimes simply called hormone negative. hr-cancers often grow faster than hr+ cancers. both the estrogen and progesterone receptors need to be negative for the cancer to be considered hr-. estrogen receptor-positive (er+) breast cancer cells 3in er+ breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells. 3in er-low-positive invasive breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 cancer cells. 3endocrine therapy might not be recommended for er-low-positive invasive breast cancer. 21 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" her2 status 21 testing for ibc \" her2 status \" biomarker testing her2 status inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of her2. human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) is a protein involved in normal cell growth. it is found on the surface of all cells. when amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and divide. some breast cancers have too many her2 genes or receptors. too many her2s is called her2-positive (her2+). you might hear it called her2 overexpression or amplification. there are 2 tests for her2: +immunohistochemistry (ihc) measures receptors. if the ihc score is 3+, the cancer is her2+. if the score is 0 or 1, it is considered her2-. if the score is 2+, further testing is needed. +in situ hybridization (ish) counts the number of copies of the her2 gene. this test is done mainly when the ihc score is unclear. her2 testing should be done on all new tumors. a tumor biopsy sample will be used. you might have more than one her2 test. immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry (ihc) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells. these cells are then studied using a microscope. ihc can find estrogen, progesterone, and her2 receptors in breast cancer cells. a pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen and/ or progesterone receptors and the number of receptors inside each cell. biomarker testing a sample from a biopsy of your tumor may be tested to look for specific dna (deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features. this information is used to choose the best treatment for you. it is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). it identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. proteins are written like this: brca. genes are written with italics like this: brca. her2 and hormone receptor status are part of biomarker testing. your treatment team will recommend the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you. tumor markers your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for proteins. examples of some tumor markers in breast cancer include carcinoembryonic antigen (cea), ca 15-3, and ca 27. 29. an increase in the level of certain tumor markers could mean that the cancer has grown or spread (progressed). however, not everyone has elevated levels of these markers and tumor markers alone are not a reliable method of detecting breast cancer. tumor mutational burden when there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor dna, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (tmb-h). tmb-h can be used to help predict response to cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the proteins called programmed 22 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biomarker testing death protein 1 (pd-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1). tumor mutation testing a sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific dna mutations. this is a different type of dna testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your parents. in tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. certain mutations such as pik3ca can be targeted with specific therapies. msi-h/d mmr mutation microsatellites are short, repeated strings of dna. when errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (mmr) proteins. some cancers have dna mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. this is called microsatellite instability (msi) or deficient mismatch repair (d mmr). when cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called msi-h (microsatellite instability-high). this is often due to d mmr genes. pd-1 and pd-l1 testing programmed death protein 1 (pd-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) are immune proteins. if either protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause your immune cells to ignore the cancer and suppress the anti-tumor immune response. if your cancer expresses either protein, you might have treatment that combines chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. this is designed to activate your immune system to better fight off the cancer cells. fish fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) is a testing method that involves special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of dna, the genetic material in a person's cells. immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry (ihc) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cancer or immune cells. the cells are then studied using a microscope. next-generation sequencing next-generation sequencing (ngs) is a high-throughput method used to determine the dna sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in your tumor. this method would only be used if enough tumor tissue remains after other biomarker testing has been completed. pcr a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a lab process that can make millions or billions of copies of your dna (genetic information). pcr is very sensitive. it can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. these copies called pcr product might be used for ngs. 23 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" genetic risk testing genetic risk testing about 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more about your cancer. a genetic counselor or trained provider will speak to you about the results. tests results may be used to guide treatment planning. genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). the goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological parents called germline mutations. some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. you can pass these genes on to your children. also, other family members might carry these mutations. tell your care team if there is a family history of cancer. brca tests everyone has brca genes. normal brca genes help to prevent tumor growth. they help fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally. brca mutations put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. mutations in brca1 or brca2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma skin cancers. mutated brca genes can also affect how well some treatments work. these tests might be repeated. what is your family cancer health history? some cancers and other diseases run in families--those who are related to you through genes passed down from biological parent to child. this information is called a family health history. ask blood relatives about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. for relatives who were diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other relatives if they are no longer living) what type of cancer they had, if they died from the cancer, and at what age the cancer was diagnosed. start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. some of the questions to ask include: 3how old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? 3what is our family's ancestry-from what countries did our ancestors originate? 24 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" distress screening 24 testing for ibc \" distress screening \" key points distress screening it is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can also change from day to day and week to week. talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. there are services and people who can help you. support and counseling are available. dealing with a cancer diagnosis may sometimes be stressful and may cause distress. your treatment team will screen your level of distress. this is part of your cancer care. distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. it can affect how you feel, think, and act. distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. you may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues. more information on distress can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. performance status performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. your state of general health will be rated using a ps scale called ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group). ps is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. your preferences about treatment are always important. ecog ps the ecog ps scores range from 0 to 5. +ps 0 means the person is fully active. +ps 1 means the person is still able to perform light to moderate activity, but with some limitations. +ps 2 means the person is limited to the chair or bed less than half of the time and is still able to care for self. +ps 3 means the person is limited to the chair or bed more than half of the time. +ps 4 means the person is totally confined to the bed or chair and completely unable to care for self. +ps 5 means the person is not alive. in breast cancer, ps might be referred to as good or poor. good ps is usually ps 0 or ps 1. 25 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" key points key points +tests are used to find cancer, plan treatment, and check how well treatment is working. +you will have a physical exam, including a breast exam, to see if anything feels or looks abnormal. +treatment can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. +blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. +imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. +a diagnostic mammogram includes detailed pictures of both breasts. it is different than a screening mammogram. +during a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples are removed for testing. samples are needed to confirm the presence of cancer and to perform cancer cell tests. +a sample from a biopsy of your tumor will be tested for estrogen receptor (er) status, progesterone receptor (pr) status, her2 status, and grade (histology). this provides information about the behavior of your cancer, as well as treatments to which your cancer may respond. +about 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing or to speak with a genetic counselor. +a sentinel lymph node (sln) is the first lymph node(s) that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. a sentinel lymph node biopsy (snlb) might be done to look for cancer in your lymph node(s). +online portals are a great way to access your test results. testing takes time. it might take days or weeks before all test results come in. 26 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 20233 breast cancer staging 27 how breast cancer is staged 28 tnm scores 31 key points 27 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" how breast cancer is staged cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis and to guide treatment decisions. it describes the size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body. it also takes into account hormone receptor and her2 status. most inflammatory breast cancers (ibcs) are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. at diagnosis, ibc is stage 3 or 4 disease. in stage 3, the tumor can be any size and in the lymph nodes, the lymph nodes can be fixed (or not moveable), or the cancer can involve the skin or chest wall. it is sometimes called advanced disease. in stage 4, cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). how breast cancer is staged a cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed. the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) created a staging system to determine how much cancer is in your body, where it is located, and what subtype you have. this is called staging. based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage. staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions. a prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take. ajcc is just one type of staging system. staging includes: +anatomic- based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (t), lymph node status (n), and distant metastasis (m). +prognostic -includes anatomic tnm plus tumor grade and the status of the biomarkers such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2), estrogen receptor (er), and progesterone receptor (pr). prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches. prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic. pathologic stage applies to those who have undergone surgery as the initial treatment for breast cancer. breast cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery. staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status. +clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment. it is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests. an example might look like c n2 or c m1. +pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery. an example might be p n2. if you are given drug therapy before surgery, then the stage might look like yp t3. staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage. often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation. more information can be gathered as treatment begins. doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next. 28 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores information gathered during staging: +the extent (size) of the tumor (t): how large is the cancer? has it grown into nearby areas? +the spread to nearby lymph nodes (n): has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? if so, how many? where? +the spread (metastasis) to distant sites (m): has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver? +estrogen receptor (er) status: does the cancer have the protein called an estrogen receptor? +progesterone receptor (pr) status: does the cancer have the protein called a progesterone receptor? +human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) status: does the cancer make too much of a protein called her2? +grade of the cancer (g): how much do the cancer cells look like normal cells? +biomarker testing: does the cancer have any genes, proteins, markers, or mutations that might suggest treatment?tnm scores the tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage breast cancer. in this system, the letters t, n, and m describe different areas of cancer growth. based on cancer test results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. the higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread. these scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. a tnm example might look like this: t3n2m0 or t32, n2, m0. +t (tumor)-depth and spread of the main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both breasts +n (node) -if cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes +m (metastasis)--if cancer has spread to distant parts of the body or metastasized t = tumor the primary tumor size can be measured in centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). one inch is equal to 2. 54 cm. a large pea is 1 cm (10 mm). a golf ball is 4 cm (40 mm). a tumor micrometastasis is a very small collection of cancerous cells smaller than 1 mm. it might be written as t1mi. ipsilateral means on the same side of the body. +t1 tumor is 2 cm (20 mm) or less +t2 tumor is 2. 1 cm to 5 cm +t3 tumor is more than 5 cm +t4 tumor is of any size and has invaded nearby structures such as the chest wall and skin of the breast t4d tumor is inflammatory carcinoma (inflammatory breast cancer) 29 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores n = regional lymph node lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that help fight infections and other diseases, drains through channels into lymphatic vessels. from here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. there are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout your body. they work as filters to help fight infection and remove harmful things from your body. regional lymph nodes are those located near the tumor in the breast. if breast cancer spreads, it often goes first to nearby lymph nodes under the arm. it can also sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the collarbone or near the breastbone. knowing if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes helps doctors find the best way to treat your cancer. +n0 means no cancer is in the regional lymph nodes. isolated tumor cells (itcs) may be present. these are malignant cell clusters no larger than 0. 2 mm. +n1mi means micrometastases (approximately 200 cells, larger than 0. 2 mm, but not larger than 2. 0 mm) are found in lymph nodes. +n1, n2, n3 means regional lymph node metastases are found. the higher the number, the more lymph nodes that have metastases. m = metastasis cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body is shown as m1. this is metastatic breast cancer (mbc). the most common sites for metastasis are bone and lung. +m0 means no evidence of distant metastasis. +m1 means distant metastasis is found. this is metastatic breast cancer. clinical staging clinical staging of lymph nodes is staging before surgery. cancer is in axillary nodes cancer is in internal mammary nodes cancer is in infraclavicular nodes cancer is in supraclavicular nodes 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores grade grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope (called histology). higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread faster than lower-grade cancers. gx means the grade can't be determined, followed by g1, g2, and g3. g3 is the highest grade for breast cancers. a low-grade tumor has a low risk of recurrence. a high-grade tumor has a higher risk of recurrence (of cancer returning). +gx-grade cannot be determined +g1-low +g2-intermediate +g3-high numbered stages numbered stages are based on tnm scores and receptor (hormone and her2) status. stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4 being the most advanced. they might be written as stage 0, stage i, stage ii, stage iii, and stage iv. stage 0 is noninvasive noninvasive breast cancer is rated stage 0. ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) is found only in the ducts (tis). it has not spread to the surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes (n0) or distant sites (m0). stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1, 2, or 3. it has grown outside the ducts, lobules, or breast skin. cancer might be in the axillary lymph nodes. stage 4 is metastatic in stage 4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to distant sites. it can develop from earlier stages. sometimes, the first diagnosis is stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (called de novo). more information on metastatic breast cancer is available at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 31 nccn guidelines for

this chapter provides an overview of treatment options and what to expect. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. care team treating breast cancer takes a team approach. treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (mdt). an mdt is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer. this team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. ask who will coordinate your care. some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. depending on your diagnosis, the care team might include the following: +a diagnostic radiologist interprets the results of mammograms, ultrasounds, and other imaging tests. +an interventional radiologist performs needle biopsies and places intravenous (iv) ports for treatment. +a pathologist analyzes the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy and provides cancer diagnosis, staging, and information about biomarker testing. +a surgical oncologist performs operations to remove cancer. +a reconstructive (plastic) surgeon performs breast reconstruction, if desired, for those who undergo mastectomy. +a medical oncologist treats cancer in adults using systemic therapy. +a radiation oncologist prescribes and delivers radiation therapy to treat cancer. +an anesthesiologist gives anesthesia, a medicine so you do not feel pain during surgery or procedures. +residents and fellows are doctors who are continuing their training, some to become specialists in a certain field of medicine. +nurse practitioners (nps) and physician assistants (pas) are health care providers. some of your clinic visits may be done by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. +oncology nurses provide your hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy, managing your care, answering questions, and helping you cope with side effects. +oncology pharmacists are experts in knowing how to use medicines to treat cancer and to manage symptoms and side effects. +palliative care nurses, advanced practice providers (apps), and physicians help provide an extra layer of support with cancer-related care. +radiation therapists provide your hands-on delivery of radiotherapy treatments. 34 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" treatment overview +nutritionists and dietitians can provide guidance on what foods are most suitable for your condition. +psychologists and psychiatrists are mental health experts who can help manage issues such as depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions that can affect how you think and feel. +social workers help people solve and cope with problems in their everyday lives. clinical social workers also diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional issues. the anxiety a person feels when diagnosed with cancer might be managed by a social worker in some cancer centers. they, or other designated professionals, can help navigate the complexities of financial and insurance stresses. +a research team helps to collect research data and coordinate care if you are in a clinical trial. clinical trials help bring new therapies to patients and advance the treatment for everyone. consider asking your care team about access to clinical trials. your physical, mental, and emotional well-being are important. help other team members understand: +how you feel +what you need +what is working and what is not keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. this will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know whom to contact with questions or concerns. treatment overview inflammatory breast cancer is treatable. treatment can be local, systemic, or usually a combination of both. local therapy focuses on the breast, chest wall, and lymph node area. it includes: +mastectomy (surgery) +radiation therapy systemic therapy works throughout the body. it includes: +chemotherapy +her2-targeted therapy +inhibitors +immunotherapy +endocrine therapy for a list of systemic therapies, see guide 2. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. 35 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" treatment overview ibc is treated with systemic therapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the breast and lymph nodes, and then radiation therapy. surgery is not always possible. even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue. systemic treatment is based on estrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr), and her2 expression. it is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan. there are many treatment options. however, not everyone will respond to treatment in the same way. some people will do better than expected. others will do worse. many factors play a role in how the cancer will respond to treatment.

procedure to remove cancer from the body. a mastectomy removes all or part of the breast. inflammatory breast cancer is often treated with a modified radical mastectomy. in a modified radical mastectomy, the breast and underarm (axilla) sentinel lymph nodes are removed. before removing the breast, the surgeon may do a sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb). sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have spread from the primary tumor. breast reconstruction is an option after a mastectomy. if you opt for reconstruction, it will be done after finishing cancer treatment. this is called delayed reconstruction. breast reconstruction is often done in stages. you might want to consult with a plastic surgeon. when preparing for surgery, seek the opinion of an experienced surgeon. the surgeon should be an expert in performing your type of surgery. hospitals that perform many surgeries often have better results. you can ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of cancer. radiation therapy radiation therapy (rt) uses high-energy radiation from x-rays, photons, protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. radiation therapy can be given alone or before or after surgery to treat or slow the growth of cancer. sometimes, radiation is given with certain systemic therapies. it may be used as supportive care to help ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer. most types of radiation include several short treatment modified radical mastectomy the dotted line shows where the entire breast and some lymph nodes are removed. part of the chest wall muscle may also be removed. 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" chemotherapy 37 treating ibc \" chemotherapy \" chemotherapy sessions that are given once daily over a few days to weeks. ask your care team which radiation option(s) are best for you and what side effects to expect. radiation may be given to the chest wall, infraclavicular region (below the collarbone), supraclavicular area (above the collarbone), or lymph nodes found in the axillary bed (armpit). lymph node radiation therapy is also called regional nodal irradiation (rni) external beam radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy (ebrt) uses a machine outside of the body called a linear accelerator (linac) to aim radiation at the whole breast (wbrt) and lymph nodes (rni). chemotherapy systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. it is used before surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of cancer (called cancer burden). +preoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given before surgery. it is also called neoadjuvant therapy. +postoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given after surgery. it is also called adjuvant therapy. chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and some normal cells. more than one chemotherapy may be used to treat inflammatory breast cancer. when only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. a combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs. warnings about supplements and drug interactions you might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. some supplements can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. this is called a drug interaction. it is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. some examples include: +turmeric +gingko biloba +green tea extract +st. john's wort +antioxidants certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. antacids, heart or blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy. therefore, it is very important to tell your care team about any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter (otc) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. bring a list with you to every visit. 38 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" myeloid growth factors some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein or injected under the skin with a needle. other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed. some examples of chemotherapy drugs include: +doxorubicin (adriamcyin), doxorubicin liposomal injection (doxil), and epirubicin (ellence) are anthracyclines. +docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel are taxanes. +capecitabine (xeloda), fluorouracil, gemcitabine (gemzar, infugem), and methotrexate are antimetabolites. most chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows the body to recover before the next cycle. cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. the number of treatment days per cycle and the total number of cycles given also vary. myeloid growth factors certain chemotherapies can reduce the cells that fight infection. treatments with myeloid growth factors (mgfs) can help increase the number of white blood cells and prevent infections. more information on myeloid growth factors, can be found in the nccn guidelines for patients: anemia and neutropenia, at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. her2-targeted therapy her2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. there might be higher amounts of her2 in your breast cancer. if this is the case, it is called her2-positive (her2+) breast cancer. her2-targeted therapy is drug therapy that treats her2+ breast cancer. most often, her2-targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy. however, it might be used alone or in combination with endocrine therapy. her2-targeted therapies include: +her2 antibodies prevent growth signals from her2 from outside the cell. they also increase the attack of immune cells on cancer cells. +her2 inhibitors stop growth signals from her2 from within the cell. +her2 conjugates or antibody drug conjugates (adcs) deliver cell- specific chemotherapy. they attach to her2s then enter the cell. once inside, chemotherapy is released. your heart will be monitored before and during treatment with trastuzumab. tests will measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart. 39 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" inhibitors 39 treating ibc \" inhibitors \" immunotherapy inhibitors this section is for inhibitors that are different from inhibitors used in her2-targeted therapy. cdk4/6 inhibitors cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. for hormone receptor-positive (hr+), her2-cancer, taking a cdk4/6 inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help control cancer longer. with all cdk4/6 regimens, those who are premenopausal must also receive ovarian ablation or suppression. cdk4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib (verzenio), palbociclib (ibrance), and ribociclib (kisqali). m tor inhibitors m tor is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. endocrine therapy may stop working if m tor becomes overactive. m tor inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy working again. everolimus (afinitor) is an m tor inhibitor. most often, it is taken with exemestane. for some, it may be taken with fulvestrant or tamoxifen. parp inhibitors cancer cells often become damaged. parp is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and allows them to survive. blocking parp can cause cancer cells to die. olaparib (lynparza) and talazoparib (talzenna) are parp inhibitors. you must have the brca1 or brca2 mutation and your breast cancer must be her2-for parp inhibitors to be considered. pik3ca inhibitor the pik3ca gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancers. a mutation in this gene can lead to increased growth of cancer cells and resistance to various treatments. alpelisib (piqray) is an example of a pik3ca inhibitor. immunotherapy immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment that tries to re-activate the immune system against tumor cells. the immune system has many on and off switches. tumors take advantage of \"off switches. \" two leading off switches are pd-1 and ctla4. immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. an immunotherapy example is pembrolizumab (keytruda). did you know? the terms \"chemotherapy\" and \"systemic therapy\" are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. systemic therapy works throughout the body and includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, and others. 40 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" endocrine therapy endocrine therapy endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or progesterone to treat hormone receptor-positive (hr+) breast cancer. the endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. hormones are natural chemicals released into the bloodstream. there are 4 hormones that might be targeted in endocrine therapy: +estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries, and also by other tissues in the body such as the fat tissue. +progesterone is made mainly by the ovaries. +luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) is made by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. it tells the ovaries to make estrogen and progesterone and testicles to make testosterone. lhrh is also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh). +androgen is made by the adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries. hormones may cause breast cancer to grow. endocrine therapy will stop your body from making hormones or it will block what hormones do in the body. this can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time. endocrine therapy is sometimes called hormone therapy. it is not the same as hormone replacement therapy used for menopause. there is one type of surgical endocrine therapy: +bilateral oophorectomy is surgery to remove both ovaries. other main types of endocrine therapy include: +ovarian ablation uses radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones. +ovarian suppression uses drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries from making hormones. it is achieved with drugs called lhrh agonists. these drugs stop lhrh from being made, which stops the ovaries from making hormones. lhrh agonists include goserelin (zoladex) and leuprolide (lupron depot). gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh) agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. +aromatase inhibitors (ais) stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase. they do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries. non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole (arimidex) and letrozole (femara). exemestane (aromasin) is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor. +estrogen receptor (er) modulators or anti-estrogens prevent hormones from binding to receptors. serms and serds are types of er modulators. selective estrogen receptor modulators (serms) block estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors. they include tamoxifen and toremifene (fareston). selective estrogen receptor degraders (serds) block and destroy estrogen receptors. fulvestrant (faslodex) and elacestrant (orserdu) are serds. 41 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" endocrine therapy +gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh) agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. +hormones may be used to treat breast cancer when taken in high doses. it is not known how hormones stop breast cancer from growing. they include ethinyl estradiol, fluoxymesterone, and megestrol acetate (megace es). those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine therapy to discuss the options. testosterone for those assigned male at birth whose bodies continue to make testosterone, endocrine therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor with

is the endocrine treatment for those in premenopause. ovarian suppression or ablation is frequently considered for higher risk er+ breast cancers. menopause in menopause, the ovaries permanently stop producing hormones and menstrual periods stop. estrogen and progesterone levels are low, but, the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat continue to make small amounts of estrogen. if you don't have periods, a test using a blood sample may be used to confirm your status. cancer treatment can cause a temporary menopause. tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment for those in premenopause. gn rh agonists may be used to temporarily induce menopause for those in premenopause. combination of gn rh agonists and tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitors may be considered as endocrine therapy for those in premenopause. ovarian suppression or ablation is frequently considered for higher risk er+ breast cancers. bone-strengthening therapy medicines that target the bones may be given to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk of bone problems. some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness. when breast cancer spreads to distant sites, it may metastasize in your bones. this puts your bones at risk for injury and disease. such problems include bone loss (osteoporosis), fractures, bone pain, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. some treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase inhibitors or gn rh agonists, can cause bone loss, which put you at an increased risk for fractures. \"my 3-month-old son stopped nursing on my left breast and it was swollen and painful. the doctor said it was mastitis, but this didn't feel the same as when i'd had that before. even with the antibiotic, it didn't improve. an ultrasound showed a questionable area in that breast and a biopsy confirmed inflammatory breast cancer (ibc). \" 43 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" clinical trials

+pamidronate (aredia) +denosumab (xgeva) you will be screened for bone weakness (osteoporosis) using a bone mineral density test. this measures how much calcium and other minerals are in your bones. it is also called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) scan and is painless. bone mineral density tests look for osteoporosis and help predict your risk for bone fractures. a baseline dexa scan is recommended before starting endocrine therapy. zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis) and fractures. zoledronic acid and denosumab are also used in those with metastatic breast cancer who have bone metastases to help reduce the likelihood of fractures, pain, or other complications arising from cancer in bone. ou might have blood tests to monitor kidney function, calcium levels, and magnesium levels. a calcium and vitamin d supplement will be recommended by your doctor. let your dentist know if you are taking any of these medicines. also, ask your care team how these medicines might affect your teeth and jaw. osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. tell your care team about any planned trips to the dentist and surgeries or dental procedures that might also affect the jaw bone. it will be important to take care of your teeth and to see a dentist before starting treatment with any of these drugs. clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of treating cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase i trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. they also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful. +phase ii trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase iii trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if 44 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" clinical trials the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase iv trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. take time to discuss with family, friends, or others whom you trust. keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. start the conversation don't wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. if you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the

clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. do i have to pay to be in a clinical trial? rarely. it depends on the study, your health insurance, and the state in which you live. in general, procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered standard of care will be billed to you or your insurance, whereas those considered research are covered by the trial sponsor. your treatment team and the research team can help determine if you are responsible for any costs. supportive care supportive care will be specific to your needs. supportive care is health care given to prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve quality of life. supportive care might include pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or family counseling. tell your care team how you are feeling and about any side effects so they can be managed. best supportive care, supportive care, and palliative care are often used interchangeably. it is very important to take care of yourself by eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising, and doing things that make you feel energized. strength is needed to sustain you during treatment. side effects all cancer treatments can cause unwanted health issues called side effects. side effects depend on many factors. these factors include the drug type and dose, length of treatment, and the person. some side effects may be harmful to your health. others may just be unpleasant. treatment can cause several side effects. some are very serious. ask for a complete list of side effects of your treatments. also, tell your treatment team about any new or worsening symptoms. there may be ways to help you feel better. there are also ways to prevent some side effects. you will be monitored closely for side effects. late effects late effects are side effects that occur months or years after a disease is diagnosed or after treatment has ended. late effects may be caused by cancer or cancer treatment. they may include physical, mental, and social problems, and second cancers. the sooner it is important to tell your care team about all side effects so they can be managed. 46 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" side effects late effects are treated the better. ask your care team about what late effects could occur. this will help you know what to look for. survivorship a person is a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. when treatment leads to remission (or no evidence of disease), you will need follow-up or survivorship care for late effects. during survivorship care you will still have a care team, but it will look different. seek out peer support groups, whether online or in-person. side effects blood clots cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood clots to form. this can block blood flow and oxygen in the body. blood clots can break loose and travel to other parts of the body causing stroke or other health issues. venous thromboembolism (vte) refers to blood clots in the veins. bone health breast cancer may spread to your bones. some breast cancer treatments may also weaken your bones. both can put your bones at increased risk for injury and disease. such problems include bone fractures, bone pain, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. high levels of calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia, may also occur. medicine may be given to help relieve bone pain and reduce the risk of other bone problems. some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness. it is recommended that you take calcium and vitamin d with these bone health medicines. talk to your doctor first. diarrhea diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel movements. your care team will tell you how to manage diarrhea. it is important to drink lots of fluids. difficulty eating sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer, or its treatment might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to your stomach (nauseated). you might have a sore mouth. healthy eating more information on supportive care is available at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 47 nccn

drinking enough fluids. a registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food can help. speak to your care team if you have trouble eating or maintaining weight. distress depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are common and are a normal part of cancer diagnosis. talk to your care team and with those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. there are services, people, and medicine that can help you. support and counseling services are available. fatigue fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to function due to lack of energy. fatigue may be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of treatment. let your care team know how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of doing the things you enjoy. eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage therapy can help. you might be referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue. hair loss chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia) all over your body -- not just on your scalp. some chemotherapy drugs are more likely than others to cause hair loss. dosage might also affect the amount of hair loss. most of the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is temporary. hair often regrows 3 to 6 months after treatment ends. your hair may be a different shade or texture. scalp cooling (or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen hair loss in those receiving certain types of chemotherapy. keep a pain diary a pain diary is a written record that helps you keep track of when you have pain, how bad it is, what causes it, and what makes it better or worse. use a pain diary to discuss your pain with your care team. you might be referred to a specialist for pain management. include in your pain diary: 3the time and dose of all medicines 3when pain starts and ends or lessens 3where you feel pain 3a description of your pain. is it throbbing, sharp, tingling, shooting, or burning? is it constant, or does it come and go? 3does the pain change at different

+anemia is a condition where your body does not have enough healthy blood cells, resulting in less oxygen being carried to your cells. you might tire easily if you are anemic. +neutropenia is a decrease in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. this puts you at risk for infection. +thrombocytopenia is a condition where there are not enough platelets found in the blood. this puts you at risk for bleeding. lymphedema lymphedema is a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling (edema). it may occur when part of the lymph system is damaged or blocked, such as during surgery to remove lymph nodes or due to radiation therapy. swelling usually develops slowly over time. it may develop during treatment or it may start years after treatment. if you have lymphedema, you may be referred to an expert in lymphedema management. the swelling may be reduced by exercise, massage, compression sleeves, and other means. ask your care team about the ways to treat lymphedema. nausea and vomiting nausea and vomiting are common side effects of treatment. you will be given medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting. neurocognitive or neuropsychological effects some treatments can damage the nervous system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with concentration, memory, and thinking. survivors are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be recommended for neuropsychological testing. neuropsychology looks at how the health of your brain affects your thinking and behavior. neuropsychological testing can identify your limits and a health care professional can create a plan to help with these limits. neuropathy neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. it usually begins in the hands or feet and gets worse over time. neuropathy may be caused by cancer or cancer treatment. most of the time, neuropathy goes away after treatment. organ issues treatment might cause your kidneys, liver, heart, and pancreas to not work as well as they should. pain tell your care team about any pain or discomfort. you might meet with a palliative care specialist or with a pain

and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview since ibc spreads quickly, treatment starts with systemic therapy to stop the spread of cancer. if the cancer responds to treatment, then surgery is performed to remove the breast and lymph nodes (modified radical mastectomy) for those assigned female at birth with stage 3 cancer. this is followed by radiation to the chest wall. if you choose breast reconstruction after a mastectomy with radiation, then delayed breast reconstruction is recommended. radiation can slow the healing process. therefore, delayed reconstruction is recommended after all the healing from radiation is done. like other breast cancers, ibc can develop in those assigned male at birth. treatment for ibc starts with preoperative systemic therapy. preoperative therapy is treatment given before surgery. it is based on the expression of estrogen receptor (er) and her2 in your tumor cells. cancer can still progress during preoperative systemic therapy. order of treatments most people with cancer will receive more than one type of treatment. below is an overview of the order of treatments. 3preoperative or neoadjuvant (before) therapy is given to shrink the tumor before a primary treatment such as surgery. 3perioperative therapy is systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, given before and after surgery. 3primary treatment is the main treatment given to rid the body of cancer. 3postoperative or adjuvant (after) therapy is given after primary treatment to rid the body of any cancer cells left behind from surgery. it is also used when the risk of cancer returning (recurrence) is felt to be high. 3first-line therapy is the first set of systemic (drug) treatment given. 3second-line therapy is the next set of treatment given if cancer progresses during or after systemic therapy. talk to your care team about your treatment plan and what it means for your stage and type of cancer. 52 nccn guidelines

nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" flat closure the look of your breast after mastectomy will depend on factors such as your body type, age, and size and shape of the area before surgery. this chapter offers more information on flat closure and breast reconstruction. the recovery time for each procedure differs. this can affect your ability to return to work or participate in activities. you might consider speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery to discuss your options and what to expect. if breast construction is something you might want, delayed reconstruction is recommended in those with ibc. flat closure in a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the entire breast, including nipple, extra skin, fat, and other tissue in the breast area are removed. the remaining skin is tightened and sewn together. no breast mound is created and no implant is added. the scar will be slightly raised and differ in color than the surrounding skin. a flat closure is not completely flat or smooth. the end result varies from person to person. ask to look at \"after\" pictures from flat closures so you know what to expect. you might decide to have a flat closure procedure at a later time or after having breast implants removed. talk to your care team to learn more. your preferences about treatment are always

breast after surgery \" breast reconstruction \" nipple replacement breast reconstruction breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild the shape and look of the breast after a mastectomy. in many cases, breast reconstruction involves a staged approach. it might require more than one procedure. if breast construction is something you might want, delayed reconstruction is recommended in those with ibc. delayed reconstruction can occur months or years after mastectomy. a plastic surgeon performs breast reconstruction. breasts can be reconstructed with implants and flaps. all methods are generally safe, but as with any surgery, there are risks. ask your treatment team for a complete list of side effects. implants breast implants are small bags filled with salt water, silicone gel, or both. they are placed under the breast skin or muscle to look like a new breast following a mastectomy. a balloon-like device, called an expander, may be used first to stretch out tissue. it will be placed under your skin or muscle and enlarged every few weeks for two to three months. when your skin is stretched to the proper size, you will have surgery to place the final implant. implants have a small risk of leaking or causing other issues. you may feel pain from the implant or expander. scar tissue or tissue death can occur. textured implants can cause breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (bia-alcl), a type of cancer. flaps breasts can be remade using tissue from other parts of your body, known as flaps. these flaps are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh, or from under the shoulder blade. some flaps are completely removed and then sewn in place. other flaps stay attached to your body but are slid over and sewn into place. there are several risks associated with flaps, including death of fat in the flap, which can cause lumps. a hernia may result from muscle weakness. problems are more likely to occur among those who have diabetes or who smoke. implants and flaps some breasts are reconstructed with both implants and flaps. this method may give the reconstructed breast more volume to match the other breast. for any reconstruction, you may need surgery on your remaining breast to match the two breasts in size and shape. nipple replacement like your breast, a nipple can be remade. to rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use surrounding tissues. also, nipples can be remade with tissue from the thigh or the other nipple. tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to look more like a nipple. it is important to note that while you can remake something to look like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of your real nipple. also, a tattoo can be done to look like a nipple without having to take tissue from another part of the body. 61 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" what to consider what to consider some things to consider when deciding to have flat closure or reconstruction after mastectomy: +your desire -you may have a strong feeling towards flat closure or one form of reconstruction after being given the options. breast reconstruction should be a shared decision between you and your care team. make your wishes known. +health issues-you may have health issues such as diabetes or a blood disorder that might affect or delay healing, or make longer procedures unsafe. +tobacco use-smoking delays wound healing and can cause mastectomy flap death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex (nac) necrosis in a nipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. in free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk of complications. you are encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction. +breast size and shape-there are limits to the available sizes of breast implants. very large breasts or breasts that lack tone or droop (called ptosis) might be difficult to match. breast reduction surgery might be an option. +body mass index (bmi) -those with an elevated bmi have an increased risk of infections and complications with breast reconstruction. if you smoke or vape, seek help to quit smoking or vaping nicotine greatly increases your chances of having side effects during and after surgery. smoking and vaping can limit how well cancer treatment works and prevent wound healing. they also increase your chances of developing other cancers. marijuana use might also affect the amount of anesthesia used during surgery. nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes you want to keep smoking and vaping. nicotine withdrawal is challenging for most people who smoke or vape. the stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit. if you smoke or vape, ask your care team about counseling and medicines to help you quit. for online support, try these websites: smoke free. gov be tobacco free. gov cdc. gov/tobacco 62 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" key points key points +flat closure is done after a mastectomy in which the skin is tightened and sewn together without the addition of a breast implant. +breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild the shape and look of the breast. if breast construction is something you might want, delayed reconstruction is recommended in those with ibc. +breasts that are fully removed in a mastectomy can be remade with breast implants, flaps, or both. +removed nipples can be remade with body tissue and/or tattooing. when i was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer (ibc) the doctor told me to stay away from the internet, but i wanted to learn all i could. you need to learn so you can advocate for yourself. not everyone has experience treating this disease. just be sure to go to reputable sources for information. \"\"we want your feedback! our goal is to provide helpful and easy-to-understand information on cancer. take our survey to let us know what we got

important to someone else. some things that may play a role in your decision-making: +what you want and how that might differ from what others want +your religious and spiritual beliefs +your feelings about certain treatments +your feelings about pain or side effects +cost of treatment, travel to treatment centers, and time away from school or work +quality of life and length of life +how active you are and the activities that are important to you think about what you want from treatment. discuss openly the risks and benefits of specific treatments and procedures. weigh options and share concerns with your care team. if you take the time to build a relationship with your care team, it will help you feel supported when considering options and making treatment decisions. second opinion

getting a second opinion, and it's a normal part of cancer care. even doctors get second opinions! things you can do to prepare: +check with your insurance company about its rules on second opinions. there may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors who are not part of your insurance plan. +make plans to have copies of all your records sent to the doctor you will see for your second opinion. support groups many people diagnosed with cancer find support groups to be helpful. support groups often include people at different stages of treatment. some people may be newly diagnosed, while others may be finished with treatment. if your hospital or community doesn't have support groups for people with cancer, check out the websites listed in this book. questions to ask possible questions to ask

2023bone cancer basics \" the bone bone cancer includes a group of cancers that start in the bone or cartilage. this is called primary bone cancer and differs from other types of cancers that can spread or metastasize to the bone. this chapter presents an overview of bone cancer. the bone bone is a living tissue made up of collagen. collagen is the most abundant protein in the body. bone tissue also contains blood vessels, nerves, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. our body has about 206 bones. bones provide structure and support, protect our organs, create blood cells, store chemicals the body needs, and produce hormones. bone is light, yet strong and can regrow. bone is made up of the following: +compact bone or cortical bone-the hard, dense outer layer of bone that is covered by a membrane of strong connective tissue called the periosteum +spongey bone or cancellous bone-the spongy, porous inner layer of bone that contains red marrow +bone marrow-found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels. there are 2 types of bone marrow: red and yellow. red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. yellow marrow is made mostly of fat. the skeletal system the human skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. it includes all of the bones and joints in the body. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" how bone is formed how bone is formed bone is a living tissue made of cells (osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts), calcium, phosphate, hydroxyapatite (a bone mineral), and collagen. new bone formation, known as ossification, starts in the womb and ends during adolescence, between 10 and 19 years of age. there are 2 forms of ossification: +compact bone (endochondral), which makes up most of the skeleton +cancellous bone (intermembranous), which includes parts of the skull, the shoulder blades, and the ends of the long bones. long bones are longer than they are wide. once ossification is complete, bone is continuously being replaced by a process called remodeling. remodeling breaks down and rebuilds bone and helps maintain normal calcium levels in the body. when calcium is needed, cells called osteoclasts break down bone. this releases calcium into the bloodstream. at the same time, bone-forming cells called osteoblasts create bone from calcium in the bloodstream. some types of bone cancer can interrupt this process. parts of bone: +epiphysis-the end of the bone, which is covered with cartilage to make a joint +metaphysis-located between the physis (growth plate) and diaphysis +diaphysis-the middle region of the bone +physis-the growth plate, which is made of cartilage. after skeletal maturity, this leaves a physeal scar or line visible in the bone anatomy of the bone the epiphysis is the end of the bone. the metaphysis is located between the physis (growth plate) and the diaphysis. the diaphysis is the middle region of the bone. 7 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" types of bone tumors 7 bone cancer basics \" types of bone tumors \" bone cancer types of bone tumors a bone tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within a bone. a bone tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). the cause of bone tumors is unknown. they often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly (the metaphysis). this book will discuss the following: +chondrosarcoma -starts in the cells that form cartilage. cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones to form a smooth surface that makes a joint. also, cartilage gives structure to the nose, ears, larynx, and other parts of the body. +chordoma -starts in notochordal cells that form the spine and vertebrae. chordomas are usually found in the lower spinal column (sacrum) or at the base of the skull. +ewing sarcoma -starts in the bone marrow and commonly occurs in the diaphysis of long bones or flat bones like the pelvis or scapula (shoulder blade). +giant cell tumor of bone (gctb)- is an overgrowth of cells found in the epiphysis. +osteosarcoma -starts in cells that form bone in the metaphysis near the growth plates. since bone cancer is very rare, many health care providers are not experts in diagnosing or treating these tumors. therefore, it is important to find a treatment center or hospital that has both experts and experience in your type of bone cancer. bone cancer cancers that start in the bone are called primary bone tumors. bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or kidney) are called secondary bone tumors or metastatic bone cancer. they behave very differently from primary bone tumors. sarcomas most primary bone cancers are sarcomas. sarcomas are a rare group of cancers. there are 2 main types of sarcomas: +soft tissue sarcomas +bone sarcomas soft tissue includes fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, blood and lymph vessels, and other supportive tissues of the body. soft tissue sarcomas are more common than bone sarcomas. bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form bone. osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common types of bone cancer. more information on soft tissue sarcomas can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 8 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023bone cancer basics \" how bone cancer spreads 8 bone cancer basics \" how bone cancer spreads \" key points how bone cancer spreads unlike normal cells, cancer cells can grow or spread to form tumors in other parts of the body. this is called a metastasis. cancer can spread through blood or the lymphatic system. the lymphatic system contains a clear fluid called lymph. lymph gives cells water and food and contains white blood cells that fight germs. lymph nodes filter lymph and remove the germs. lymph travels throughout the body in vessels like blood does. lymph vessels and nodes are found everywhere in the body. although cancer can spread through your blood, you cannot spread your cancer to other people if they are exposed to your blood. bone cancer can spread to the lung or other bones. bone cancer that has metastasized to the lung is still called bone cancer. key points +bone cancer is a group of cancers that start in the bone or cartilage. this is called primary bone cancer. bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or kidney) are called secondary or metastatic bone tumors. +bone tumors may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). the cause of bone tumors is unknown. +bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form bone. most primary bone cancers are sarcomas. +osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common types of bone cancer. +bone cancer can metastasize to the lungs and other bones. +it is important to find a treatment center or hospital that has both experts and experience in your type of bone cancer. 9 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 20232

biomarker tests 20 key points 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" test results 10 testing for bone cancer \" test results \" general health tests treatment planning starts with testing. accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat primary bone cancer. a biopsy is recommended before starting treatment. this chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. test results results from imaging studies and biopsies will be used to determine your treatment plan. it is important you understand what these tests mean. ask questions and keep copies of your test results. online patient portals are a great way to access your test results. keep these things in mind: +choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment. +bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. +write down questions and take notes during appointments. don't be afraid to ask your care team questions. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. +get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. +bring all images on a compact disc (cd). you can request a disc from the hospital or center where you had your imaging. x-rays, mris, and ct scans cannot be faxed. if you are meeting a new doctor, please bring all your images on a cd. +organize your papers. create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. you can do the same on your computer. +keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. add it to your phone. hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. keep your primary care physician (pcp) informed of changes to this list. you are encouraged to keep your pcp. they are great partners in your care. +include in your contact list information on the exact type of cancer, as well as any treatment and the date it started. general health tests medical history a medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. some supplements interact and affect prescriptions that your doctor may give you. tell your doctor about any symptoms you have. a medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" general health tests family history some cancers and other diseases can run in families. your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. this information is called a family history. ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. it's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations. physical exam during a physical exam, your health care provider may: +check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and breathing rate +check your height and weight +listen to your lungs and heart +look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat +feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. +feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. for possible tests, see guide 1. guide 1 possible tests: those 40 years of age and over medical history and physical exam bone scan chest x-ray blood tests such as complete blood count (cbc), comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) with calcium to assess for hypercalcemia chest/abdominal/pelvic ct with contrast biopsy, as needed, performed by orthopedic oncologist at center where you will be treated * those under 40 years of age will be referred to an orthopedic oncologist bring a list of any medications, vitamins, over-the-counter drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. 12 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" fertility (all genders) 12 testing for bone cancer \" fertility (all genders) \" preventing pregnancy fertility (all genders) treatment such as chemotherapy can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. if you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. to preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't really sure at the moment. fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. more information on fertility preservation in adolescents and young adults can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. changes in fertility treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily impaired or interrupted. this temporary loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy. preventing pregnancy preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. cancer and cancer treatment can affect the ovaries and damage sperm. hormonal birth control may or may not be recommended, so ask your doctor about options such as intrauterine devices (iuds) and barrier methods. types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. those with ovaries those who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test before starting treatment. cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby if you are or become pregnant during treatment. therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy during and after treatment is recommended. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be avoided. menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your \"period\" may stop during treatment, but often returns within 2 years after treatment in those 40 years of age and under. it is still possible to become pregnant even though you might not have a period. therefore, birth control is recommended during and after treatment. consult your doctor for the best time to plan a pregnancy. those with testicles cancer and cancer treatment can damage sperm. therefore, use contraception (birth control) such as condoms to prevent pregnancy during and immediately after cancer treatment. 13 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" performance status 13 testing for bone cancer \" performance status \" blood tests performance status performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. your state of general health will be rated using a ps scale called ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group). ps is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. your preferences about treatment are always important. the ecog ps scores range from 0 to 5. +ps 0 means the person is fully active. +ps 1 means the person is still able to perform light to moderate activity, but with some limitations. +ps 2 means the person is limited to the chair or bed less than half of the time and still able to care for self. +ps 3 means the person is limited to the chair or bed more than half of the time. +ps 4 means the person is totally confined to the bed or chair and completely unable to care for self. +ps 5 means the person is not alive. good ps is usually ps 0 or ps 1. blood tests blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. they require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into your vein. some blood tests you might have are described next. alkaline phosphatase alkaline phosphatase (alp) is an enzyme found in the blood. high levels of alp levels can be a sign of bone tumors, liver disorders, or pregnancy. a bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of alp. performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" blood tests complete blood count a complete blood count (cbc) measures the levels of red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs), and platelets (plts) in your blood. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding. comprehensive metabolic panel a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) measures 14 different substances in your blood. it is usually done on the plasma part of your blood. a cmp provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. a cmp will look for higher than normal calcium levels in your blood called hypercalcemia. calcium is the most common mineral in the body. it is needed for healthy teeth, bones, and other body tissues. bone damage from cancer can cause your bones to release calcium into the bloodstream. lactate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) or lactic acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most cells. dying cells release ldh into blood. fast-growing cells, such as tumor cells, also release ldh. pregnancy test those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins. those with bone cancer should be treated at centers experienced in this type of cancer. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" imaging tests imaging tests imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. a radiologist, who is an expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. your doctor will discuss the results with you. you will not have all of the following tests. x-ray an x-ray is a type of radiation. in small doses, it is used to make pictures of the inside of the body. it might be referred to as a radiograph. bone scan a bone scan uses a radiotracer. a radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. it can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. however, the test is quick and painless. a special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health problems. ct scan a computed tomography (ct or cat) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. it takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. all the images are combined to make one detailed picture. intravenous (iv) contrast is often used. ct machine a ct machine is large and has a tunnel in the middle. during the test, you will lie on the table that moves slowly through the tunnel. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" imaging tests contrast contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body. contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. it is used to make the pictures clearer. the contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine immediately after the test. the types of contrast vary and are different for ct and mri. tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past, especially to iodine or to shellfish such as shrimp. this is important. you might be given medicines, such as benadryl and prednisone, to avoid the effects of those allergies. contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well. mammogram a mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. the pictures are made using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. diagnostic mammograms are made with more x-rays than screening mammograms. a bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. it is used to identify any tumors, and if so, the number and size of the tumor(s). a mammogram might be needed to confirm that the cancer found in your bones is not from breast cancer. mri scan a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. it does not use x-rays. during the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. contrast might be used. a closed mri has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. an open mri has a magnet top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. most people prefer to find a location with an open mri. tell your doctor if you have any metal in your body or if you tend to have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces). you might be surprised how tight a fit it is and how confined you might feel even in an open mri. pet/ct scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. a tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow. cancer cells show up as bright spots on pet scans. however, not all tumors will appear on a pet scan. also, not all bright spots are cancer. it is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on pet. inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. when a pet scan is combined with ct, it is called a pet/ct scan. it may be done with one or two machines depending on the cancer center. a whole-body pet/ct or head-to-toe scan can be used to look for evidence of cancer throughout your body. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biopsy 17 testing for bone cancer \" biopsy \" genetic testing biopsy a biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue for testing. a diagnosis of bone cancer is confirmed using a core needle or surgical biopsy. the placement of the biopsy is critical. therefore, it is recommended that the biopsy be performed at an experienced center where you will receive treatment. +core needle biopsy removes tissue samples with a large, hollow needle that can grab a piece of tissue. this is frequently performed under light sedation by an interventional radiologist. it can also be performed by your surgeon in the office. +surgical biopsy removes a sample of the tumor through a small incision. a surgical biopsy should be performed by your treating surgeon. this requires a trip to the operating room. bone marrow tests bone marrow tests might be done in certain cases. there are 2 types of bone marrow tests that are often done at the same time: +bone marrow aspirate +bone marrow biopsy your bone marrow is like a sponge holding liquid and cells. an aspirate takes some of the liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy takes a piece of the sponge. the samples are usually taken from the back of the hip bone (pelvis). you will likely lie on your belly or side. your doctors will first clean and give sedation and/or numb your skin and outer surface of your bone. for an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed through your skin and into the bone. liquid bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe. for the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to remove a core sample. you may feel bone pain at your hip for a few days. your skin may bruise. genetic testing genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup). the goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological parents called germline mutations. some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. you can pass these genes on to your children. also, family members might carry these mutations. tell your doctor if there is a family history of cancer. there are 3 major types of genetic testing: +cytogenetic -to examine whole chromosomes +biochemical-to measure proteins produced by genes +molecular-to look for dna or gene mutations and/or gene fusions while it can be confusing, just know that testing done to look for an inherited gene mutation or an inherited risk of cancer is different than genetic testing done on cancer cells or testing to look for proteins produced by cancer cells. 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests 18 testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests \" biomarker tests biomarker tests inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) molecules. these molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome. chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell. normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes. each chromosome contains thousands of genes. genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make. a mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code. a sample from your biopsy will undergo lab tests to look for specific dna mutations/ alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features. this information is used to learn more about your cancer and to choose the best treatment for you. it is sometimes called molecular testing, tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). it identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. proteins are written like this: idh1. genes are written with italics like this: idh1. when a gene or protein is found, it is shown with a plus sign (+) like this: idh1+. when a gene or protein has not been found, it is written with a negative sign (-) like this: idh1-. ewing sarcoma a cell must make a copy of its chromosomes before dividing into two cells. sometimes, there are mistakes in the copies. one type of mistake is when parts (dna) of two chromosomes break off and switch with each other. this is called a translocation. it can result in a fusion of two genes. a translocation between chromosome 11 and 22 is written as t(11;22) and is common in ewing sarcoma. ewing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion of the ews gene (ewsr1) on chromosome 22 with various members of the ets gene family (fli1, erg, etv1, etv4, and fev), with fli1 being the most common. almost everyone with ewing sarcoma will have one of the possible gene fusions. this is not inherited from your parents, but happens for some other reason. when this occurs only in cancer cells, this is called a somatic mutation or somatic change. msi-h/d mmr mutation microsatellites are short, repeated strings of dna. when errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (mmr) proteins. some cancers have dna mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. this is called microsatellite instability (msi) or deficient mismatch repair (d mmr). when cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called msi-h (microsatellite instability-high). this is often due to d mmr genes. pembrolizumab (keytruda) is an option for those with unresectable or metastatic, microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023testing for bone cancer \" biomarker tests tumor mutational burden when there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor dna, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (tmb-h). pembrolizumab (keytruda), nivolumab (opdivo), or ipilimumab (yervoy) might be used in some cases for tmb-h tumors. tumor mutation testing a sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific mutations. in tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. idh1 mutation some mutations such as idh1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase) gene mutations can be targeted with specific therapies. ivosidenib (tibsovo) is for those with chondrosarcoma who are susceptible to idh1 mutations. next-generation sequencing next-generation sequencing (ngs) is a high-throughput method used to determine the dna sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in your bone tumor. pcr a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a lab process that can make millions or billions of copies of your dna (genetic information). pcr is very sensitive. it can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. these copies are called pcr product. what is your family health history? some cancers and other diseases run in families --those who are related to you through genes passed down from parent to child. this information is called a family health history. you can ask family members about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. for relatives who have died, ask about the cause and age of death. start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. some of the questions to ask include: 3do you have any chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, or health conditions such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol? 3have you had any other diseases, such as cancer or stroke? 3how old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? 3what is our family's ancestry--from what countries did our ancestors originate? 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone

cancer staging is used to make treatment decisions. it describes the size and location of the tumor, and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body. this chapter provides a general overview of cancer staging. overview there are many staging systems. most staging systems include information about: +where the tumor is located in the body +the cell type (such as sarcoma or carcinoma) +the size of the tumor +whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes +whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body +tumor grade, which refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look and how likely the tumor is to grow and spread tnm score the tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage most bone cancers. in this system, the letters t, n, and m describe different areas of cancer growth. based on imaging and biopsy results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. the higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. these scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. a tnm example might look like this: t1n0m0 or t1, n0, m0. this might represent a stage 1 cancer. +t

care team treatment for bone cancer is based on the type, size, and location of the tumor. this chapter presents an overview of the types of treatment and what to expect. not everyone will receive the same treatment. care team treating bone cancer takes a team approach. treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (mdt). an mdt is a team of doctors, health care workers, and social care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience with your type of cancer. this team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. ask who will coordinate your care. some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. the mdt should meet on a regular basis and should include the following: +an orthopedic oncologist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors. they treat any area of the body except the neck and skull and inside the chest and abdomen. +a medical or pediatric oncologist treats cancer using systemic (drug) therapy. +a radiation oncologist prescribes and plans radiation therapy to treat cancer. +a musculoskeletal radiologist interprets the results of x-rays and other imaging tests. +a bone pathologist interprets the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy or surgery. depending on your type of care, the team might include: +a thoracic surgeon who performs operations within the chest. +a plastic surgeon who performs operations to improve function or reconstruct missing areas. +an interventional radiologist who performs needle biopsies, ablation therapies, and embolizations, and places ports for treatment. +a physiatrist, a medical doctor who specializes in physical movement and rehabilitation. +a vascular surgeon who specializes in procedures involving arteries, veins, and lymph circulation. +a surgical oncologist or general surgeon who has specialized knowledge and experience related to the diagnosis, preoperative, operative, and postoperative care for the whole patient. +a neurosurgeon who specializes in surgery on the nervous system, especially the brain and spinal cord. 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" surgery +an orthopedic oncologist or orthopedic surgeon who focuses on the body's musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, tendons, and nerves. +an orthopedic spine surgeon who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of spinal diseases and conditions. may be an orthopedic oncologist. your physical, mental, and emotional well-being are important. you know yourself better than anyone. help other team members understand: +how you feel +what you need +what is working and what is not keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. this will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know who to contact with questions or concerns. surgery surgery is an operation or procedure to remove cancer from the body. the type of surgery depends on size, location, and number of tumor(s). surgery can be used to: +remove all of the tumor +relieve pain or discomfort the goal of surgery is to remove all of the cancer. to full remove all of the cancer, your surgeon must cut out the tumor with a rim of normal tissue around the edge. this allows the pathologist to determine a surgical margin. a clear or negative margin resection (r0) is when no cancerous cells are found in the tissue around the edge of the tumor. an r1 positive margin or r1 resection indicates the surgeon has removed all of the visible tumor, but the microscopic margins are still positive for tumor cells. in an r2 positive margin, the surgeon does not or is unable to remove all of the visible tumor. a tumor that can be removed completely with surgery is called resectable. not all tumors are resectable. you might receive treatment to shrink a tumor or the amount of cancer before surgery. this is called preoperative or neoadjuvant treatment. treatment after surgery might be referred to as postoperative or adjuvant. when preparing for surgery, seek care or ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of bone cancer. it is important to find an experienced surgeon who has performed this type of procedure many times with good results. limb-sparing resection for bone cancer in the limbs, the goal of surgery, whenever possible, is to preserve or maintain limb function. this is called limb-sparing surgery. a surgeon who is an expert in your type of bone cancer should be consulted before deciding upon surgical treatment options. rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy, will likely be part of a limb-sparing treatment plan. this may include occupational therapy to help with daily life skills or physical therapy to help your body move and function. a physiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in rehabilitation. 31 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" surgery amputation amputation is the removal of a limb or other body part. a surgeon who is an expert in your type of bone cancer should be consulted before amputation. one type of amputation is a rotationplasty. in a rotationplasty, the bottom of the femur, the knee, and the top of the tibia are removed. the lower leg is then rotated and attached to the femur. the intention of this surgery is to allow knee function when it otherwise would not be possible. rehabilitation, such as physical and occupational therapy, will be part of any amputation. seek a peer support group to connect with others who have experienced the loss of a limb. this will aid in your recovery and help you to maintain an active lifestyle. a physiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in rehabilitation. palliative surgery surgery to ease pain or discomfort is called palliative surgery. it might be used to remove metastases that are causing pain. surgery to remove a metastasis is called a metastasectomy. this is different from a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. palliative surgery is sometimes offered to fix a broken bone or help prevent a cancerous bone from breaking. order of treatments most people with cancer will receive more than one type of treatment. below is an overview of the order of treatments. 3preoperative or neoadjuvant (before) therapy is given to shrink the tumor before a primary treatment such as surgery. 3perioperative therapy is systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, given before and after surgery. 3primary treatment is the main treatment given to rid the body of cancer. 3postoperative or adjuvant (after) therapy is given after primary treatment to rid the body of any cancer cells left behind from surgery. it is also used when the risk of cancer returning (recurrence) is felt to be high. 3definitive treatment is the best treatment after all choices have been considered. 3first-line therapy is the first set of systemic (drug) treatment given. 3second-line therapy is the next set of treatment given if cancer progresses during or after systemic therapy. talk to your care team about your treatment plan and what it means for your stage and type of cancer. 32 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" systemic therapy systemic therapy systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. each works differently. types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. systemic therapy might be used alone or with other therapies. goals of systemic therapy should be discussed before starting treatment. the choice of therapy takes into consideration many factors, including age, other serious health issues, and future treatment possibilities. your preferences about treatment are important. if you have any religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds of treatment, now would be the time to share them with your care team. warnings! you might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain food or herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. some supplements and food can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. this is called a drug interaction. it is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. some examples include: +turmeric +gingko biloba +green tea extract +st. john's wort certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. antacids, heart medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy. this is why it is important to tell your doctor about any medications, vitamins, over-the-counter (otc) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. bring a list with you to every visit. chemotherapy chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and normal cells. more than one chemotherapy drug may be used to treat your type of cancer. when only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. a combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs. some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein or injected under the skin with a needle. other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed. the final dose differs between people because it is based on body weight and height. intrathecal chemotherapy is injected into spinal or brain fluid. in most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows the body to recover before the next cycle. cycles vary in length depending on which chemotherapy is used. you will have tests to see how well treatment is working. you might spend time in the hospital during treatment. targeted therapy targeted therapy is drug therapy that focuses on specific or unique features of cancer cells. targeted therapies seek out how cancer cells grow, divide, and move in the body. these drugs stop the action of molecules that help cancer cells grow and/or survive. some targeted therapy drugs block the chemical signals that tell cancer cells to grow. other targeted therapy drugs block signals that cause new blood vessels to form. others target hormones. 33 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" radiation therapy immunotherapy immunotherapy is drug therapy that increases the activity of your immune system. by doing so, it improves your body's ability to find and destroy cancer cells. immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. radiation therapy radiation therapy (rt) uses high-energy radiation from photons, electrons, or protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. it is given over a certain period of time. radiation therapy can be given alone or with certain systemic therapies. when used as supportive care to help ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer, it is called palliative rt. radiation may be given: +as the primary (first) treatment +before surgery, called neoadjuvant rt, to shrink the tumor before surgery +after surgery, called adjuvant rt, to kill any cancerous cells that remain +as palliative treatment to ease pain or discomfort caused by bone tumors external beam radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy (ebrt) uses a machine outside of the body to aim radiation at the tumor(s). there is more than one type of ebrt used in the treatment of bone cancer. these allow for safer, higher doses of radiation. types of ebrt that may be used to treat your cancer include: +stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) uses high-energy radiation beams to treat cancers in 5 or fewer treatments. +stereotactic radiosurgery (srs) uses special equipment to position the body and give one precise, large dose of radiation. +three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3d-crt) uses computer software and ct images to aim beams that match the shape of the tumor. +intensity-modulated radiation therapy (imrt) uses small beams of different strengths to match the shape of the tumor. +particle beam radiation therapy uses protons, carbon ions, or other heavy ions to treat bone cancer. internal radiation internal radiation called brachytherapy is placed inside the body as a solid implant similar to beads or seeds. radiopharmaceuticals radiopharmaceuticals contain a radioactive substance that emits radiation. this radioactive substance is different than contrast material used in imaging. samarium 153-edtmp or sm153-edtmp (quadramet) is a beta-particle-emitting, bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical. it is injected into a vein and distributed throughout the body, where it is absorbed in areas where cancer has invaded the bone. 34 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" clinical trials clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase i trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. they also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful. +phase ii trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase iii trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase iv trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. take time to discuss with family, friends, or others whom you trust. keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. start the conversation don't wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. if you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the requirements. if you have already started standard treatment you may not be eligible for certain clinical trials. try not to be discouraged if you cannot join. new clinical trials are always becoming available. 35 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" clinical trials frequently asked questions there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. are clinical trials free? there is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. the study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. you may, however, have costs indirectly related to the trial, such as the cost of transportation or child care due to extra appointments. during the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. this care is billed to--and often covered by-- insurance. you are responsible for copays and any costs for this care that are not covered by your insurance. finding a clinical trial in the united states nccn cancer centers nccn. org/cancercenters the national cancer

ablation ablation uses extreme cold or extreme heat to destroy cancer cells. it can destroy small tumors with little harm to nearby tissue. there are 2 types of thermal ablation used to destroy cancer cells: +cryotherapy or cryosurgery +radiofrequency ablation (rfa) both types of ablation use a special needle, called a probe, which is inserted into the tumor. with cryotherapy, a medical gas is passed through the probe to cause below-freezing temperatures. this freezes the tumor to destroy it. with rfa, the probe emits radio waves to heat the tumor and destroy it. the probe can be guided into place with a ct scan, ultrasound, or other imaging tests. the probe will be removed when treatment is done. embolization embolization treats tumors by cutting off their blood supply. a catheter will be inserted into an artery and guided to the tumor. once in place, beads will be inserted to block the blood flow. with chemoembolization, the beads are coated with chemotherapy. radioembolization uses small radioactive beads. supportive care supportive care is health care that relieves symptoms caused by cancer or its treatment and improves quality of life. it might include pain relief (palliative care), emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or family counseling. supportive care is given during all cancer stages. tell your care team how you are feeling and about any side effects. best supportive care is used with other treatments to improve quality of life. best supportive care, supportive care, and palliative care are often used interchangeably. it is important to tell your care team about all side effects so they can be managed. 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023treatment overview \" key points key points +treatment

is most commonly found in the thigh bone (femur), arm (humerus), or pelvis. treatment is based on the grade of the tumor and if it can be removed with surgery. a tumor that can be removed with surgery is called resectable. an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. surgery to remove all of the tumor is called wide excision. treatment is grouped as follows: +low grade and intracompartmental (intracompartmental tumor has not grown outside of the bone) +high grade (grade 2 or 3), clear cell, or extracompartmental (tumor has grown outside of the bone) +metastatic disease at initial diagnosis +dedifferentiated-treated with ewing sarcoma therapy +mesenchymal-treated with ewing sarcoma therapy treatment treatment options will be based on your wishes and your care team's recommendations. low-grade and intracompartmental chondrosarcoma a low-grade (grade 1) and intracompartmental tumor is still within the bone. it has not grown through the bone wall or spread to any other part of the body. these tumors are sometimes called atypical cartilaginous tumors. depending on the location of the tumor, treatment is intralesional excision (surgery) to remove part of the tumor. this is also called curettage. intralesional excision is not an option for pelvic tumors. after treatment you will be monitored with the following tests for the return of cancer called recurrence. +physical exam +x-rays of primary site and/or mri or ct (both with contrast) as needed every 6 to 12 months for 2 years, then yearly as needed +chest imaging every 6 to 12 months for 2

chordoma \" overview \" treatment chordoma is a slow-growing sarcoma that usually starts in the lower spinal column or at the base of the skull. it often grows into the soft tissue around the bone making it difficult to treat. treatment options include surgery or radiation therapy. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview chordomas are a type of cancerous tumor that can occur anywhere along the spine, from the base of the skull to the tailbone. these tumors grow slowly, gradually invading nearby bone and soft tissue. tumors often involve critical structures such as the brainstem, spinal cord, and important nerves and arteries. for this reason, chordomas are difficult to treat. they can also come back, or recur, after treatment--usually in the same place as the first tumor. this is called a local recurrence. in about 2 out of 5 people, the tumor eventually spreads, or metastasizes, to other parts of the body. this chapter is for conventional or chondroid chordomas. those with chordoma should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team who are experts in the management of chordoma. before starting treatment, you will have imaging tests of the main (primary) sarcoma site. for those with poorly differentiated or dedifferentiated chordoma, see information on soft tissue sarcomas at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. treatment chordomas are treated based on the location of the tumor: +tumors in the spine that include the sacrum and coccyx +tumors at or in the base of the skull a tumor that can be removed with surgery is called resectable. an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery and might be treated with radiation therapy (rt). chordomas often grown outside the bone into surrounding tissue near vital organs, veins, and arteries. parts of these tissues might also need to be removed and sewn back together. this is called resection. the goal is to remove as much of the tumor as possible. tumors in spine for tumors in the spine: +if a tumor is resectable, rt might be given before, during, or after surgery. +if a tumor

group of cancers that start in the bone or soft tissue. treatment begins with chemotherapy. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview ewing sarcoma is a cancerous tumor that occurs in bone or soft tissue. soft tissue includes muscle, organs, or nerves. there are 2 types of ewing sarcoma: +ewing sarcoma of bone +ewing sarcoma of soft tissues ewing sarcoma of bone usually occurs in the thigh (femur), pelvis, and bones of the chest. however, any bone may be affected. when arising in a long bone, the diaphysis is the most common site. ewing sarcoma can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), usually to the lungs, to other bones, or to the bone marrow. testing before starting treatment, you will have imaging, blood, and other tests. treatment can alter fertility. therefore, you might be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss fertility preservation options before starting treatment. for possible tests, see guide 5.

local control treatment with local control treatment, the goal is to surgically remove all cancer or destroy all cancer cells with rt. sometimes, both surgery and rt are needed. chemotherapy might be given to complete the full course of treatment. the best treatment for each person with ewing sarcoma is determined by a multidisciplinary cancer team and shared decision-making with the person with cancer and/or family. monitoring after completing local control treatment, you will be monitored to watch for signs that cancer has returned called relapse or recurrence. monitoring includes physical exams, blood tests, and imaging scans. if ewing sarcoma relapses, treatment is chemotherapy with the possibility of more surgery or radiation therapy. disease progression when cancer does not respond or progresses after primary treatment, then local control therapy such as radiation therapy (rt) and/ or surgery might be considered to prevent the spread of cancer or to ease symptoms. if cancer continues to progress, then options include a second-line chemotherapy or best supportive care. supportive care aims to improve quality of life. for second-line systemic therapy options, see guide 7.

unpredictable disease that tends to return. treatment is needed to prevent severe bone damage. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview giant cell tumor of bone (gctb) is a rare, aggressive, non-cancerous tumor. it generally happens in adults between 20 and 40 years of age, when skeletal bone growth is complete. when viewed under a microscope, the tumor consists of many very large cells or \"giant\" cells. it is not known what causes a giant cell tumor. gctb usually develops near a joint at the end of the bone. the knee is the most common location, but it can be found in the bones of the arms and the legs. it can also affect the flat bones, such as the breastbone or pelvis. gctb has a strong tendency to return to the same location. this is called local recurrence. it may also appear in the lungs (metastasize). when possible, treatment for a giant cell tumor almost always involves surgery to remove the tumor. treatment aims to prevent damage to the bone near the affected joint. before starting treatment, you will have a biopsy to confirm diagnosis and imaging tests to see if the cancer is in one area (localized) or has spread to distant sites (metastasized). giant cell tumor of bone giant cell tumors are often found at the end of the thigh bone (femur). 55 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f bone cancer, 2023giant cell tumor of bone \" localized disease 55 giant cell tumor of bone \" localized disease \" metastatic disease localized disease in localized disease, cancer is confined to one area. due to the location of the tumor or if you have other more serious health issues, surgery might not be possible. if this is the case, see unresectable treatment options. resectable a resectable tumor can be removed with surgery. when possible, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. frequently, first-line surgery involves an intralesional excision or curettage to save normal bone and scrape out all tumor cells. sometimes, a bigger surgery (wide resection) is required to remove all bone containing the tumor. this wide resection type of surgery can require reconstruction of the bone or joint. at the time of surgery, your surgeon might use treatment like ablation or embolization to help prevent the return of the tumor. unresectable an unresectable tumor cannot be removed with surgery. it might include those with a resectable tumor, but who have other more serious health conditions that prevent surgery. treatments include: +denosumab (preferred) and/or +embolization (preferred) and/or +radiation therapy (rt) there are some risks with rt and long-term use of denosumab. you should see a dentist before starting denosumab. discuss with your care team which treatment is right for you. after treatment you will have imaging tests, such as x-rays, ct, and mri. if tests find that the tumor is now resectable, you will have surgery to remove the tumor. metastatic disease in metastatic disease, there is more than one tumor. while gctb is usually benign, it can metastasize to the lungs or other bone. for resectable tumors, you might have surgery to remove the main tumor and metastasis. for unresectable tumors, options include: +denosumab +radiation therapy +observation you should see a dentist before starting denosumab. observation is sometimes referred to as watch-and-wait. ask what this might mean for you. your preferences about treatment are always important. talk to your care team and make your wishes known. 56 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f

overview \" testing osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer. it usually occurs around the knee or shoulder. treatment is a combination of therapies. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview osteosarcoma starts in bone-forming cells called osteoblasts. the cause is not known. in some cases, osteosarcoma runs in families. osteosarcoma is commonly found in large bones in the area of bone with the fastest growth rate. however, it can occur in any bone. osteosarcoma tends to occur in bones of the: +shin (near the knee) +thigh (near the knee) +upper arm (near the shoulder) there are 3 types of osteosarcoma: +intramedullary (inside the bone) +surface (on the bone surface) +extraskeletal (outside the bone known as soft tissue sarcoma)for treating extraskeletal osteosarcomas, see information on soft tissue sarcomas at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. testing before starting treatment, you will have imaging and blood tests. treatment can alter fertility. therefore, you might be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss fertility preservation options before starting

high-grade osteosarcoma this section is for high-grade osteosarcoma. other types of high-grade non-osteosarcoma such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (ups) of bone could also be treated the same way. treatment involves chemotherapy, then surgery, followed by more chemotherapy. systemic therapy before surgery for most, treatment starts with preoperative chemotherapy. the goal of chemotherapy is to kill the cancer cells before surgery. after chemotherapy, you will have an imaging test to restage your cancer, assess treatment response, and plan surgery. surgery or local control therapy most osteosarcomas are treated with surgery to remove all of the cancer cells in your body. mri and ct scans helps determine if the osteosarcoma can be removed with surgery. most osteosarcomas are resectable with limb-sparing surgery. this means the surgeon removes the bone containing cancer and reconstructs the limb. some osteosarcomas require amputation. rarely, the tumor is unresectable. in this case, treatment then involves radiation therapy or ablation. systemic therapy after surgery treatment after surgery is called adjuvant treatment. when no cancer is found in the surgical margin, it is called a negative margin. treatment is chemotherapy. when cancer remains in the surgical margin, it is called a positive margin. treatment might be chemotherapy, or more surgery. radiation therapy might follow surgery. metastatic disease at diagnosis this section is for those with metastatic disease at diagnosis. metastases can be found in the lungs (pulmonary), bone (skeletal), or internal organs (visceral). these are often resectable. surgery to remove a metastasis is called a metastasectomy. this is different from a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. some metastases might be treated with systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or other therapies. for example, unresectable lung metastases might be treated with ablation. if surgery is not possible, then treatment might be systemic therapy or radiation therapy. before starting systemic therapy, tumor mutational burden (tmb) and biomarker testing might be done. 61 nccn guidelines for

osteosarcoma periosteal osteosarcoma periosteal osteosarcoma starts in the surface of the bone called the periosteum. treatment is surgery to remove the tumor called wide excision. chemotherapy might be given before surgery to reduce the size of tumor or the amount of cancer. low-grade osteosarcoma or parosteal osteosarcoma treatment for low-grade osteosarcoma is surgery to remove the tumor called wide excision. chemotherapy might follow surgery if a high-grade component is found unexpectedly in the surgical specimen. parosteal osteosarcoma usually only requires surgery. dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcomas are not considered to be low-grade tumors. monitoring after completing treatment, you will be monitored to watch for signs that cancer has returned called recurrence or relapse. monitoring includes physical exam, blood and imaging tests, functional movement assessment, and regular visits with your orthopedist and oncologist. relapse if cancer returns, treatment is systemic therapy and/or surgery. surgery is not always possible. systemic therapy options can be found in guide 11. after treatment for relapse you will have imaging tests. if your cancer has responded to treatment, then you will be monitored for the return of cancer (relapse) or for progression. treatment options for relapse and disease progression include: +surgery to remove tumor

having an open and honest conversation with your care team. it's your choice in shared decision-making, you and your doctors share information, discuss the options, and agree on a treatment plan. it starts with an open and honest conversation between you and your care team. treatment decisions are very personal. what is important to you may not be important to someone else. some things that may play a role in your decision-making: +what you want and how that might differ from what others want +your religious and spiritual beliefs +your feelings about certain treatments +your feelings about pain or side effects +cost of treatment, travel to treatment centers, and time away from school or work +quality of life and length of life +how active you are and the activities that are important to you think about what you want from treatment. discuss openly the risks and benefits of specific treatments and procedures. weigh options and share concerns with your care team. if you take the time to build a relationship with your care team, it will help you feel supported when considering options and making treatment decisions. second opinion it is normal to want to start treatment as soon as possible. while cancer can't be ignored, there is time to have another doctor review your test results and suggest a treatment plan. this is called getting a second opinion, and it's a normal part of cancer care. even doctors get second opinions! things you can do to prepare: +check with your insurance company about its rules on second opinions. there may be out-of-pocket costs to see doctors who are not part of your insurance plan. +make plans to have copies of all your records sent to the doctor you will see for your second opinion. support groups many people diagnosed with cancer find support groups to be helpful. support groups often include people at different stages of treatment. some people may be newly diagnosed, while others may be finished with treatment. if your hospital or community doesn't have support groups for people with cancer, check out the websites listed in this book. questions to ask possible questions to ask your care team are listed on the following pages.

cancer, 2024colon cancer basics \" the colon colon cancer is common and treatable. many cancers that start in the colon can be cured, especially when found early. the colon the colon makes up most of the large intestine (bowel). in the colon water is absorbed from eaten food, turning it into feces or stool. after leaving the colon, stool moves into the rectum. the rectum is the last 6 inches or so of the large bowel. stool is held here until it leaves the body through an opening called the anus. the term colorectal cancer is used to describe cancers that form in either the colon or rectum. while these cancers are similar, their treatment is different. the focus of this guide is colon cancer. for information on rectal cancer treatment, see the nccn guidelines for patients: rectal cancer at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. the colon the start of the colon is a pouch called the cecum. sticking out from the cecum is the appendix. this skinny tube is about the size of a finger and is closed at one end. the rest of the colon has 4 main sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024colon cancer basics \" polyps 6 colon cancer basics \" polyps \" key points polyps polyps are non-cancerous growths that form on the inner lining of the colon and rectum. the most common type is called an adenoma. while it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive colon cancer. cancer that forms in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma. this is the most common type of colon cancer. polyps that rarely turn into cancer include hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps. while most polyps do not become cancer, almost all colon cancers start in a polyp. removing polyps can prevent cancer before it starts. most can be removed during a colonoscopy using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy. polyps can also be tested to make sure that cancer has not already started to develop. for more information, see the nccn guidelines for patients: colorectal cancer screening at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. key points this guide discusses the following key topics about colon cancer diagnosis and treatment. testing and treatment planning +testing the tumor for a biomarker (feature) called mismatch

key points 8 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" mismatch repair testing 8 testing and treatment planning \" mismatch repair testing \" family health history this chapter describes testing and other care needed to create your treatment plan. all colon cancers should be tested for mutations (changes) in genes that fix damaged dna, called mismatch repair (mmr) genes. most colon cancers are found during colonoscopy. it is common to have another colonoscopy to thoroughly examine the colon and look for other possible areas of cancer. this is called a diagnostic colonoscopy. mismatch repair testing mismatch repair (mmr) or microsatellite instability (msi) testing is recommended for everyone diagnosed with colon cancer. this feature of some colon cancers is a type of biomarker. biomarkers are targetable changes of a cancer that help guide your treatment. testing involves analyzing a piece of the colon tumor in a lab. depending on the method used, an abnormal result is called either microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) or mismatch repair deficient (d mmr). tumors that do not have these changes are referred to as microsatellite stable (mss) or mismatch repair proficient (p mmr). if the cancer is d mmr/msi-h, you will also be tested for an inherited condition called lynch syndrome, described next. family health history your doctor will ask about the health history of your biological (related by blood) family members. those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer are more likely to have this cancer compared to the average person. most colon cancers occur for unknown reasons. while rare, some people are born with a disorder that makes them more likely to get colon and other cancers. these are called inherited cancer syndromes. two such conditions include lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (fap). people born with lynch syndrome are at high risk of developing colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancers. lynch syndrome is caused by inherited mutations of the mmr genes. for cancers found to have the d mmr/msi-h biomarker, testing for lynch syndrome is recommended. fap causes hundreds to thousands of polyps to form in the colon and rectum. the polyps start as benign growths, but over time can become invasive colon cancer. cancer often develops by age 50 in people with classic fap. a milder form (attenuated fap) causes fewer polyps and usually starts later in life. if an inherited syndrome is suspected, your doctor will refer you to a genetic counselor. this expert can speak with you and your family about testing for syndromes related to colon cancer. to be tested, you must provide a sample of blood or saliva. a pathologist tests the sample for gene mutations that cause these syndromes. it is important to meet with a genetic counselor before having any genetic testing. 9 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" blood tests blood tests the following tests are not used alone to diagnose colon cancer, but abnormal results may signal health problems. complete blood count cancer and other health problems can cause low or high blood cell counts. a complete blood count (cbc) measures the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in a blood sample. white blood cells help the body to fight infection. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. platelets help wounds heal by forming blood clots. chemistry profile also known as a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp), this group of tests provides information about how well your kidneys, liver, and other organs are working. cea blood test carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) is a protein found in blood. the level of cea is often higher than normal in people with colon cancer, especially if the cancer has spread to other organs. monitoring cea can be helpful even when the cancer is only in the colon and the level is normal, because the level will rise if the cancer later spreads to other organs. however, monitoring cea is not helpful for everyone, even if the cancer has spread. people who are pregnant and those who smoke may have higher cea levels. ct dna there is growing interest in circulating tumor dna (ct dna) testing for people with early-stage colon cancer. also called a liquid biopsy, this test looks for small pieces of dna released by tumor cells into the blood. it can detect microscopic disease that may remain in the body after colectomy. this information may be helpful in predicting the risk of the cancer returning or other outcomes. but more information is needed, and at this time ct dna testing is only recommended as part of a clinical trial. i was diagnosed in the er at age 44, 58 days after my wedding, and i faced biases and unexpected challenges. i had to fight to get care because i was dismissed for more than a year for so many different reasons. my journey taught me this: never give up, explore every reasonable option, and prioritize your mental health. your life is the only one you have, so be true to yourself. before any diagnosis, put on your life jacket first--take care of yourself. get screened, know your family history. when facing colorectal cancer, the best care begins with self-care. \"\" 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" imaging imaging imaging tests can show areas of cancer inside the body. a radiologist interprets the images and conveys the results to your oncologist. your care team will tell you how to prepare for your scans. if you get nervous in tight spaces, let them know. you may be offered a type of medicine called a sedative to help you relax. ct computed tomography (ct) is the main imaging test used to see colon cancer in the body. during the scan you will lie face-up on a table that moves through a tunnel-like machine. you will be able to hear and speak with a technician at all times. a substance called contrast is used to make the pictures clearer. it is injected into your vein and mixed with a liquid to drink. you may feel flushed or get hives. some people have an allergic reaction. tell your doctor if you've had problems with contrast in the past. mri magnetic resonance imaging (mri) is not often used to plan treatment for colon cancer. your doctor may order an mri to get a better look at the liver or rectum, or if the ct scan results are unclear. getting an mri is much like getting a ct scan. in some cases, the area of the body being imaged is placed within a narrowed coil device that looks like a brace. it covers your body from below your chest to the top of your legs. it sends and receives radio waves. straps may be used to help you stay in place. an mri may cause your body to feel warm. if mri is being used to better see cancer near the rectum, an enema may be needed. or a gel may be inserted into the rectum beforehand. ct scan ct with contrast is the main imaging test used to determine the extent of colon cancer in the body. ct takes many pictures of the inside of the body using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make one detailed picture. 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024testing and treatment planning \" fertility and family planning fertility and family planning for unknown reasons, colon cancer is being diagnosed more often in young adults. some cancer treatments make it hard or impossible to have children. if you are interested in potentially having children in the future, tell your care team. they will discuss any fertility-related risks of your treatment plan with you. some methods for preserving (keeping) fertility before cancer treatment are described below. your doctor may refer you for counseling about fertility preservation options. sperm banking sperm banking stores semen for later use by freezing it in liquid nitrogen. the medical term for this is semen cryopreservation. egg freezing unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and stored for later use. this is called egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation. ovarian tissue banking this method involves removing part or all of an ovary and freezing the part that contains the eggs. the frozen tissue that contains the eggs can later be unfrozen and put back in the body. for more information on fertility and family planning, see the nccn guidelines for patients for adolescent and young adult cancer at nccn. org/ patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 12 nccn guidelines for

of the colon, but can also form as lesions. this chapter explains treatment for cancer that has not spread to areas far from the colon. polyps with cancer a polyp is an overgrowth of cells on the inner lining of the colon wall. the most common type is called an adenoma. while it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive colon cancer. cancer that starts in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma. there are 2 main shapes of polyps. pedunculated polyps are shaped like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall. they have a stalk and round top. sessile polyps are flatter and do not have a stalk. a polyp in which cancer has just started to grow is called a malignant (cancerous) polyp. most polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy, using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy. colon polyps polyps are growths on the inner lining of the bowel wall. some look like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall. these are called pedunculated polyps. others are flatter and do not have a stalk. these are called sessile polyps. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer often, no further treatment is needed after a polypectomy. in other cases, surgery (resection) of a bigger piece of the colon is needed. this depends on: +the size and shape of the polyp (pedunculated or sessile), +the polypectomy results, and +the results of testing the removed tissue. before deciding whether resection is needed after a polypectomy, your doctor will review the results of testing with you and discuss your options. invasive cancer for cancers not found early enough to be removed by polypectomy, colectomy (colon surgery) is needed. surgery is only an option if the colon tumor can be completely removed. if you cannot have surgery first, see page 19. colectomy a colectomy is a surgery that removes the part of the colon with cancer. after the cancerous part is removed, the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are sewn or stapled together. at least 12 lymph nodes near the tumor will be removed and tested for cancer, in addition to any nodes that look abnormal to the surgeon. a colectomy can be done in two ways. the open method removes tumor tissue through a colectomy surgery for colon cancer is called colectomy. it involves removing the cancerous part of the colon. the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are then attached to each other. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer large cut in your abdomen. the minimally invasive method involves making a few small cuts. tools are inserted through the cuts to see and remove part of your colon. the tissue removed during surgery is sent to a pathologist. the pathologist determines how far the cancer has grown within the colon wall. they also test the removed lymph nodes for cancer. these results are used to assign the cancer a stage. the stage helps determine whether you need chemotherapy after surgery. at the time of colectomy, some people may also have a procedure called a colostomy. this is done in cases where it may not be safe to reconnect the remaining sections of colon. in a colostomy, the remaining upper part of the colon is attached to an opening on the surface of the abdomen. this opening is called a stoma. stool exits the body through the stoma and enters a bag attached to the skin. this is typically only needed for a short time. for colon cancer surgery, the colostomy can often be reversed with another operation. colostomy is also known as diversion because it diverts (redirects) the flow of stool. colostomy if the two healthy ends of the remaining colon cannot be safely reconnected after the cancer is removed, a colostomy may be performed. a colostomy connects a part of the colon to the outside of the abdomen. this creates an opening in your abdomen that allows stool to pass through. for colon cancer surgery, it is rare for a colostomy not to be reversed with another operation. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer bowel blockage in rare cases, a tumor may grow so large that it blocks the flow of stool. there are several ways to deal with a blockage. one option is a colectomy that also unblocks the bowel. this is known as a one-stage colectomy. a second option is colectomy with colostomy. this is typically only needed for a short time. another possibility is that a colostomy may be done first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer. lastly, in rare cases, a mesh metal tube called a stent may be placed first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer. the stent keeps the colon open, allowing gas and stool to pass. staging the cancer stage describes the extent of cancer in the body. having a general idea of the structure of the colon wall is helpful for understanding how colon cancer is staged. the colon wall is made of layers of tissue. cancer starts in the innermost layer that comes in contact with food. this layer is called the mucosa. the next layer is the submucosa. it is made of connective tissue and contains mucus glands, blood and lymph vessels, and nerves. the submucosa is followed by a layer of muscle called the muscularis propria. the outer, fourth layer is called serosa (or adventitia). if left untreated, cancer cells grow through the layers of the colon wall, towards the inside of the abdomen. the cancer can then invade structures or organs outside of the colon. cancer cells can also break off from the colon tumor and travel through lymph or blood to nearby lymph nodes. the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage colon cancer. in the ajcc system, the following key pieces of information about the cancer are used to give it a stage:your care team will give you information on: how to prepare for surgery what to expect during and after surgery recovery possible short-and long-term side effects of colectomy, including: !leaking from the spot where the colon was reconnected (anastomotic leak) !changes in bowel habits !bowel blocked by scar tissue !organs pushing through tissues or muscles weakened by surgery (hernia) 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" invasive cancer +t: how far the tumor has grown into or through the colon wall +n: whether any lymph nodes have cancer +m: whether the cancer has spread to areas or organs outside the colon (metastasized) the t, n, and m scores are combined to assign the cancer one of the following stages: 0, i (1), ii (2), iii (3), or iv (4). the stages are explained below. stage 0 there are abnormal cells on the innermost layer of the colon wall. these abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into deeper layers of the colon wall. stage 0 colon cancer is also called carcinoma in situ of the colon. stage 1 the cancer has grown into either the second or third layer of the colon wall. there is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon. stage 2 the cancer has grown into, or beyond, the fourth layer of the colon wall. there is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon. stage 3 the cancer has spread from the colon to nearby lymph nodes or there are tumor deposits. tumor deposits are small tumors in the fat around the colon. stage 4 the cancer has spread to areas outside the colon and nearby lymph nodes. colon cancer spreads most often to the liver and/or lungs. if you can't have surgery first having surgery first is not always an option. it may not be possible because of the location of the tumor, or because of other health problems. in this case, systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) is given first. systemic therapy may also be given first for advanced cancers, or cancer that has spread to lymph nodes. if this approach is planned, chemotherapy is recommended for p mmr/mss cancers. immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor is preferred for d mmr/msi-h cancers. immunotherapy increases the activity of your immune system, improving your body's ability to find and destroy cancer cells. checkpoint inhibitors recommended for use before colectomy in d mmr/msi-h cancers include: +pembrolizumab (keytruda) +nivolumab (opdivo) with or without ipilimumab (yervoy) sometimes radiation therapy (alone or with chemotherapy) is given along with systemic therapy for unresectable cancers. for more information on the side effects of checkpoint inhibitors, see the nccn guidelines for patients: immunotherapy side effects: immune checkpoint inhibitors at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" chemotherapy after surgery chemotherapy after surgery chemotherapy is the use of medicine to kill cancer cells. it is a type of systemic therapy. chemotherapy is usually given intravenously. this means the medicine is slowly infused into the bloodstream through a vein. it travels through the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body. chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows your body to recover between cycles. cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. stage 1 chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 1 cancers. stage 2 chemotherapy is not recommended after colectomy for stage 2a and 2b d mmr/msi-h cancers, but may be given for some stage 2c d mmr/msi-h cancers. chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for some stage 2 p mmr/mss cancers. it is most helpful for cancers with a high risk of recurrence (returning after treatment). your doctor will consider the features and risk factors of the cancer to determine if recurrence is likely. if chemotherapy is planned, recommended regimens include capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)/leucovorin. these are given for 6 months. folfox and capeox are recommended options for high-risk cancers. folfox is given for 6 months; capeox for 3 months. stage 3 chemotherapy is recommended after colectomy for all stage 3 colon cancers. preferred regimens include capeox and folfox. other recommended options include capecitabine and 5-fu. chemotherapy is typically given for 3 to 6 months. the length of treatment depends on the regimen and the risk of recurrence. side effects systemic therapy kills both cancer cells and healthy cells. the damage to healthy cells can cause hair loss, cracked skin, mouth sores, and other side effects. managing side effects is a shared effort between you and your care team. it is important to speak up about bothersome side effects, such as nausea and vomiting. ask about your options for managing or relieving the effects of treatment. more information on supportive care is available at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for non-metastatic cancer \" surveillance surveillance follow-up testing is started when there are no signs of cancer after treatment. it can help find new cancer growth early. stage 1 a colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery for stage 1 cancers. if the results are normal, your next colonoscopy should be in 3 years, and then every 5 years. if a concerning or high-risk adenoma is found, your next colonoscopy will be needed within 1 year. if you don't have any symptoms, other testing is not needed on a regular basis. imaging tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the cancer may have come back or spread. stages 2 and 3 in addition to colonoscopy, surveillance for stages 2 and 3 colon cancer includes physical exams, carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood tests, and ct scans. the recommended schedule for surveillance testing is shown in guide 1. in addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. for more information, see chapter 5: survivorship. guide 1 stages 2 and 3-surveillance after treatment physical exam and cea blood test first 2 years: every 3 to 6 months next 3 years: every 6 months ct of chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 to 12 months for 5 years colonoscopy you did not have a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 3 to 6 months after surgery. you had a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery. if no advanced adenomas are found, repeat in 3 years. after that, repeat every 5 years. 21 nccn guidelines for

23 treatment for metastatic cancer \" biomarker testing \" local therapies colon cancer spreads most often to the liver, sometimes to the lungs, and less often to the abdomen or other areas. cancer that has metastasized by the time it is diagnosed is stage 4. biomarker testing biomarkers are targetable features of a cancer. they are often mutations (changes) in particular genes. when possible, biomarker testing is performed on a piece of tumor tissue removed during a biopsy or surgery. if this isn't possible, a sample of blood can be tested. all metastatic colon cancers should be tested for the following biomarkers: +mismatch repair deficiency/high microsatellite instability (d mmr/msi-h) (if not already performed) +ras (kras and nras ) mutations +braf mutations +her2 amplification testing for many biomarkers at one time is called next-generation sequencing (ngs). ngs can find other, rare biomarkers for which targeted treatments may be available, including: +pole/pold1 mutations +ret fusions +ntrk fusions local therapies your treatment options may include local therapies. these are treatments that target liver and lung tumors directly. some are interventional oncology/radiology techniques, also known as image-guided therapies. these techniques use imaging, such as ultrasound or computed tomography (ct), to deliver minimally invasive cancer treatments. using imaging during the procedure allows your doctor to precisely target the tumor(s). a team of experts can determine the best local therapy for your metastatic tumor(s). to learn if surgery or treatment with other local therapies is an option, your case should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of experts. the team should include a surgeon experienced in removing liver and lung tumors and an interventional oncologist/radiologist. resection surgery to remove liver and/or lung tumors is called resection. resection is often preferred for removing colon cancer that has spread to these organs. image-guided thermal ablation (described on the next page) may be used: +with resection, if surgery is not expected to completely remove the tumors +instead of resection, if the tumors are small and can be completely destroyed if a liver resection is needed, your liver may need to be enlarged first. this is done using a minimally invasive procedure called portal 24 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" local therapies vein embolization. an interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into certain veins in the liver. this blocks the blood vessel to the liver tumor, causing the healthy part of the liver to grow. ablation image-guided thermal ablation destroys small liver or lung tumors. a specialized needle is placed directly into or next to the target tumor. this probe delivers targeted energy to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissue. radiofrequency and microwave ablation are commonly used methods that kill cancer cells using heat. cold energy (cryoablation) is used sometimes, mostly for lung tumors. less common types include irreversible electroporation (\"nanoknife\") and laser ablation. thermal ablation may be used in addition to surgery, or alone for small tumors that can be fully removed. it will only be used if all visible areas of cancer can be destroyed. ablation may be performed by either an interventional radiologist or a surgeon. sometimes it can be done in a single session in the interventional radiology department. liver-directed therapies embolization if the cancer has spread only (or mainly) to the liver, treatment with intra-arterial liver-directed therapies may be an option. these therapies may be considered for liver tumors that: +didn't improve (or stopped improving) with chemotherapy, and +cannot be resected or ablated. intra-arterial therapies treat liver tumors with chemotherapy beads (chemoembolization) or radioactive spheres (radioembolization). if radiation spheres are used, it is known as selective internal radiation therapy (sirt) or transarterial hepatic radioembolization (tare). these procedures are performed by interventional oncologists/radiologists. a catheter is inserted into an artery in your leg or wrist and guided to the liver tumor(s). once in place, the spheres or beads are injected into the blood vessel leading to the tumor. they collect inside the tumor and deliver radiation or chemotherapy, causing the cancer cells to die. the chemotherapy beads can also work to starve the tumor by stopping its blood supply. the chemotherapy or radiation further damage the cancer cells and cause the tumor to shrink. when embolization with chemotherapy is not an option, small beads may be used to physically block blood supply to the tumor. this is called bland embolization. haic hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (haic) is chemotherapy given directly to the liver. it is often given in addition to standard intravenous chemotherapy. using a port or pump that is 25 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" local therapies usually placed during surgery to remove liver tumors, the drugs are funneled directly into the artery leading to the liver. haic should only be performed by medical oncologists at treatment centers with experience in this method. stereotactic body radiation therapy stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) is a highly specialized type of external beam radiation therapy (ebrt). it may be used to treat colon cancer that has spread to the liver, lungs, or bone. in sbrt, high doses of radiation are delivered to metastatic tumor(s) using very precise beams. the radiation comes from a large machine outside the body. the radiation passes through skin and other tissue to reach the tumor(s). treatment with sbrt is typically complete in 5 or fewer sessions, called fractions. stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) sbrt may be used to treat colon cancer that has spread to the liver, lungs, or bone. high doses of radiation are delivered to a metastatic site or sites using very precise beams. treatment is typically given in 5 or fewer sessions. 26 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs when possible, surgery and systemic therapy is the recommended treatment approach for these cancers. the choice of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or immunotherapy) depends on the mismatch repair (mmr) status of the cancer. surgery involves colectomy to remove the colon tumor. the liver or lung tumors are resected when the colectomy is performed, or later as a separate surgery. if the metastatic tumors are small, removing or destroying them with local therapies may be an option--alone or with surgery. p mmr/mss cancer your doctor may recommend 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy before, after, or between surgeries. this is in addition to the chemotherapy that is recommended for everyone after surgery, called adjuvant chemotherapy. the goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to kill any cancer cells that may remain in the body. either folfox or capeox is preferred. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. after chemotherapy, surveillance begins. if all areas of cancer cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies, stage 4 colon cancer is treated with systemic therapy. systemic therapy given first is called first-line therapy. recommended first-line regimens are listed below. the targeted therapy bevacizumab (avastin) may be added to any of these regimens: +folfiri +folfox +capeox +folfirinox for some p mmr/mss cancers, folfiri or folfox may be given with a targeted therapy--either panitumumab (vectibix) or cetuximab (erbitux). these regimens are only recommended for tumors without ras (kras or nras) or braf mutations. while uncommon, systemic therapy may shrink the tumors enough to be removed with surgery and/or local therapies. after surgery, most people will have more systemic therapy. in some cases, observation or a short course of chemotherapy may be possible. if the tumors do not become resectable during first-line therapy, systemic therapy is typically continued. the goal is to slow the growth and spread of the cancer. if the cancer progresses, the regimen you receive next may be different from what you had before. the choice will depend on prior systemic therapy you've had and how well you are expected to tolerate certain regimens. another important factor is whether the tumor has any biomarkers. regimens targeting specific biomarkers are listed in guide 2 on the next page. 27 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the liver or lungs if the cancer progresses through all available regimens, recommended options if you are eligible include: +targeted therapy with fruquintinib (fruzaqla) +chemotherapy with trifluridine and tipiracil (lonsurf) +targeted therapy with regorafenib (stivarga) all are tablets taken by mouth. the targeted therapy bevacizumab may be given with lonsurf. d mmr/msi-h or pole/pold1-mutated cancer the preferred treatment approach for resectable stage 4 d mmr/msi-h or pole/ pold1-mutated cancers is immunotherapy followed by surgery. immunotherapy is only recommended if you haven't already had treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. recommended options include: +nivolumab (opdivo), which may be given with ipilimumab (yervoy) +pembrolizumab (keytruda) +dostarlimab-gxly (jemperli) guide 2 biomarker-based treatments for p mmr/mss cancers braf v600e mutation

guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" stage 4 cancer in the abdomen another recommended treatment approach for these cancers is surgery followed by chemotherapy. either folfox or capeox is preferred. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. if all areas of cancer cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies, stage 4 colon cancer is treated with systemic therapy. if you are a candidate and haven't had immunotherapy, treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is recommended. your doctor will check the extent of the cancer every 2 to 3 months. surgery may become possible. or you may continue immunotherapy or switch to a different systemic therapy. if you've already had immunotherapy, another type of systemic therapy is recommended. stage 4 cancer in the abdomen some people with metastatic colon cancer will also form tumors in the layer of tissue that lines the abdomen, called the peritoneum. the peritoneum covers most of the abdominal organs. in most cases, systemic therapy is given with the goal of relieving or preventing symptoms. the regimen you receive will depend on whether the tumor has any biomarkers and how well you are expected to tolerate certain systemic therapies. tumors growing in or around the bowel can block stool from moving and leaving the body. in this case, the bowel needs to be unblocked before starting systemic therapy. this is done using one of several surgical techniques, or with a mesh metal tube called a stent. cytoreductive surgery and hipec in a small number of people, cytoreductive surgery and/or hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (hipec) may be treatment options. but research is needed on whether the benefits of these treatments outweigh the possible harms. they are only used in specialized centers and under certain circumstances. cytoreductive surgery involves surgically removing all visible tumors. if the tumor cannot be separated from the surface of an organ, the organ may also need to be removed. in hipec, a heated chemotherapy solution is put directly into the abdominal cavity through small tubes called catheters. 29 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" surveillance surveillance surveillance after treatment for stage 4 colon cancer includes: +colonoscopies +physical exams +carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood tests +computed tomography (ct) scans the recommended schedule for surveillance testing is shown in guide 3. in addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors. for more information, see chapter 5: survivorship. guide 3 surveillance after treatment for stage 4 colon cancer physical exam and cea blood

a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 3 to 6 months after surgery. you had a total colonoscopy at diagnosis: colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery. if no advanced adenomas are found, repeat in 3 years. after that, repeat every 5 years. it's ok to have bad days but don't let yourself stay there. a positive attitude goes a long way. \"\" 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" distant recurrence distant recurrence after treatment for non-metastatic colon cancer, the cancer may return and spread to the liver, lungs, or other areas. this is called a distant recurrence. treatment with surgery and/or local therapies is recommended if all of the tumors can be totally removed. but, this is uncommon, and most distant recurrences are treated with systemic therapy. systemic therapy may shrink the tumors enough to be removed with surgery. if your doctor thinks this might be possible, the size of the tumors will be checked about every 2 months during systemic therapy. if the cancer does not become resectable, systemic therapy is typically continued. the goal is to slow the growth and spread of the cancer. specific recommendations are provided below according to the mismatch repair status of the cancer and whether resection is possible. unresectable p mmr/mss cancer if you've had recent treatment with folfox or capeox, you should not have more chemotherapy that includes oxaliplatin. oxaliplatin can cause serious nerve damage. your options for systemic therapy will depend, in part, on whether the cancer has any biomarkers. therapies targeting the biomarkers listed below are available: +her2 amplification +kras g12c mutation +braf mutations +ntrk gene fusion +ret gene fusion for cancers without biomarkers, chemotherapy with folfiri or irinotecan is a recommended first-line option. a biologic may be given with chemotherapy. biologics include bevacizumab, ziv-aflibercept, ramucirumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab. resectable p mmr/mss cancer if you have received treatment with chemotherapy, one recommended option is resection (and/or treatment with local therapies) first, followed by either chemotherapy or observation. observation is preferred for those who have already had treatment with oxaliplatin. a second option is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection (and/or treatment with local therapies). more chemotherapy may follow. if you have not had any chemotherapy, resection (and/or treatment with local therapies) is often performed first, followed by chemotherapy. folfox and capeox are preferred for chemotherapy. capecitabine and 5-fu/leucovorin are also options if needed. a second option for those who haven't had any chemotherapy is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection and/or treatment with local therapies. more chemotherapy may follow. 31 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f colon cancer, 2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" distant recurrence unresectable d mmr/msi-h or pole/pold1-mutated cancer if you are a candidate and haven't had immunotherapy, treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor is recommended. your doctor will check the extent of the cancer every 2 to 3 months. surgery may become possible. or, you may continue immunotherapy or switch to a different systemic therapy. if you've already had immunotherapy, another type of systemic therapy is recommended. this may be oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy such as folfox or capeox. or, if the cancer has any other biomarkers, targeted therapy may be an option. resectable d mmr/msi-h or pole/ pold1-mutated cancer there are 2 options for treating resectable, distant recurrences of d mmr/msi-h cancer. local therapies may be used together with resection, or used alone for very small tumors. if you have not had immunotherapy, recommended options include: +immunotherapy, followed by observation or resection +resection followed by chemotherapy if you have received checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, one recommended option is resection first, followed by either chemotherapy or observation. observation is recommended for those who have already had treatment with oxaliplatin. a second option is 2 to 3 months of chemotherapy first, followed by resection. more chemotherapy may follow. supportive care is

2024treatment for metastatic cancer \" clinical trials clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase 1 trials study the safety and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. +phase 2 trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase 3 trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase 4 trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it. take time to discuss with family, friends, or others whom you trust. keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time. start the conversation don't wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials. start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options. if you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team

for metastatic cancer \" clinical trials frequently asked questions there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. are clinical trials free? there is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial. the study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug. you may, however, have costs indirectly related to the trial, such as the cost of transportation or child care due to extra appointments. during the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care. this care is billed to--and often covered by-- insurance. you are

treatments may be used in addition to or in place of surgery if all areas of cancer can be removed. +to learn if surgery or treatment with other local therapies is an option, your case should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of experts. stage 4 colon cancer +when possible, treatment with surgery and systemic therapy is recommended. the choice of chemotherapy or immunotherapy depends on the mismatch repair status of the cancer. +stage 4 cancer that cannot be removed with surgery and/or local therapies is treated with systemic therapy. +for colon cancer that has spread to the peritoneum, systemic therapy is usually given. the goal is to relieve or prevent symptoms. distant recurrence +the return and spread of stage 1, 2, or 3 colon cancer to areas far from the colon is called a distant recurrence. +most distant recurrences are treated with systemic therapy. clinical trials +clinical trials provide access to investigational treatments that may, in time, be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). as the care partner for my stage iv husband, i would share that you must advocate for them. however, be respectful of their feelings and ensure you're

with side effects colon cancer survivors may experience both short-and long-term health effects of cancer and its treatment. the effects depend in part on the treatment(s) received. surgery, anti-cancer medicines, and radiation therapy all have unique potential side effects. diarrhea or incontinence colon surgery can cause changes to your bowel habits. you may experience changes in the frequency or urgency of your bowel movements. diarrhea refers to having frequent and watery bowel movements. incontinence is the inability to control urination (urinary incontinence) or bowel movements (fecal incontinence). the following may help with these side effects: +anti-diarrhea medicines +changing your diet +strengthening your pelvic floor +wearing protective undergarments nerve damage the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin can damage nerves in your fingers and toes. symptoms include numbness, cramping, tingling, or pain in these areas. acupuncture and heat may help. if you have painful nerve damage, a drug called duloxetine (cymbalta) may help. ostomy care if you have an ostomy, you may want to join an ostomy support group. another option is to 37 nccn guidelines for

active lifestyles. however, it's a good idea to talk to an ostomy professional before doing any intense physical activity. paying for care cancer survivors face a unique financial burden. paying for doctor visits, tests, and treatments can become unmanageable, especially for those with little or no health insurance. you may also have costs not directly related to treatment, such as travel expenses and the cost of childcare or missed work. the term financial toxicity is used to describe the problems patients face related to the cost of medical care. financial toxicity can affect your quality of life and access to needed health care. if you need help paying for your cancer care, financial assistance may be available. talk with a patient navigator, your treatment team's social worker, and your hospital's financial services department. some of the resources listed on page 46 contain helpful information on paying for cancer care. i am a stage iii colon cancer survivor. i

important to keep up with other aspects of your health after cancer treatment. steps you can take to help prevent other health problems and to improve your quality of life are described next. cancer screening and other care get screened for other types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, and skin cancer. your primary care doctor can advise you on which screening tests you should have based on your age and risk level. other health care get other recommended health care for your age, such as blood pressure screening, hepatitis c screening, and immunizations (like the flu shot). diet and exercise try to exercise for at least 150 minutes per week. alcohol may increase the risk of certain cancers. drink little to no alcohol. a low glycemic load (gl) diet may help prevent the return of colon cancer. low gl foods cause a slower and smaller rise in blood sugar levels compared to other carbohydrate-containing foods. talk to your doctor about a low glycemic load diet. aspirin talk to your doctor about the possible risks and benefits of long-term aspirin therapy to help prevent the return of colorectal cancers. quit smoking if you smoke or vape, quit! your doctor will be able to provide (or refer you for) counseling on how to stop smoking. experts recommend eating a diet that includes a lot of plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. 39 nccn guidelines

gland found on the chest. the breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue. behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs. muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place. breast tissue contains glands that can make milk. these milk glands are called lobules. lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes. small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple. the ring of darker breast skin is called the areola. the raised tip within the areola is called the nipple. the nipple-areola complex (nac) is a term that refers to both parts. lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food. it also helps to fight germs. lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla). nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (alns) invasive ductal carcinoma most inflammatory breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. 6 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer basics \" breast cancer 6 breast cancer basics \" breast cancer \" inflammatory breast cancer breast cancer breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast. almost all breast cancers are a subtype called carcinomas. carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body. there are different types of breast carcinoma. the most common types are either ductal or lobular. +ductal carcinoma starts in the cells that line the milk ducts. milk ducts are thin tubes that carry milk from the lobules of the breast to the nipple. it is the most common type of breast cancer. +lobular carcinoma starts in the lobules (milk glands) of the breast. it is the second most common type of breast cancer. inflammatory breast cancer most inflammatory breast cancers (ibcs) are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. it's important not to dismiss any strange skin changes to the breast, including redness, swollen nipple area, or warmth to the touch. seek medical attention right away. possible signs of ibc: +peau d'orange (pitted or dimpled appearance of skin) +skin thickening (skin has an orange-peel texture) +edema (swelling caused by excess fluid in body tissue) +erythema (reddening of the skin, usually in patches) inflammatory breast cancer in inflammatory breast cancer (ibc), cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. this causes the breast to look red and swollen and feel warm to the touch. 7 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast

assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders. key points +anyone can develop breast cancer, but breast cancer occurs more frequently in persons assigned female at birth. +inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and connective tissue. lobules are structures that make breast milk. ducts carry breast milk from the lobules to the nipple.

patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" test results treatment planning starts with testing. this chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect. ibc can be difficult to diagnose. often, there is no lump that can be felt during a breast exam or seen on a mammogram. since there is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema) of the breast, ibc can look like an infection and therefore be difficult to diagnose. often, a biopsy of the affected skin is done to diagnose the tumor. test results you will have blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to stage the cancer. the biopsy sample will be tested for hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and her2 receptors. treatment will be based on these findings. it is important you understand what these tests mean. ask questions and keep copies of your test results. online patient portals are a great way to access your test results. keep these things in mind: +choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment. +bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible. +write down questions and take notes during appointments. don't be afraid to ask your care team questions. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. +get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have. +organize your papers. create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results. you can do the same on your computer. +keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team. add it to your phone. hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency. keep your primary care physician (pcp) informed of changes to this list. +include in your contact list information on the exact type of cancer, as well as any treatments and the date they started. for possible tests, see guide 1. 10 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" general health tests general health tests medical history a medical history is a record of all health issues and treatments you have had in your life. be prepared to list any illness or injury and when it happened. bring a list of old and new medicines and any over-the-counter (otc) medicines, herbals, or supplements you take. some supplements interact and affect medicines that your care team may prescribe. tell your care team about any symptoms you have. a medical history, sometimes called a health history, will help determine which treatment is best for you. family history some cancers and other diseases can run in families. your doctor will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives. this information is called a family history. ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. it's important to know the specific type of cancer, or where the cancer started, and if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing. guide 1 possible tests medical history and physical exam (h&p) by multidisciplinary team. medical photographs will also be taken. complete blood count (cbc), comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) including liver function tests (lfts), and alkaline phosphatase biopsy with pathology review determine tumor status including: estrogen receptor (er) and progesterone receptor (pr) hormone receptor (hr) status her2 status address fertility, birth control, and sexual health concerns genetic counseling and testing if at risk for hereditary breast cancer imaging: diagnostic mammogram. ultrasound and breast mri, as needed chest ct. contrast might be used. ct or mri of abdomen with or without pelvis. contrast will be used. bone scan or pet-ct 11 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f

breathing rate +check your height and weight +listen to your lungs and heart +look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat +feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. +examine your breasts to look for lumps, nipple discharge or bleeding, or skin changes. +feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin. clinical breast exam clinical breast exam (cbe) is a physical exam of the bare breast performed by a health care provider to check for lumps or other changes. it is done while you are seated and/or lying down. your provider should take time to palpate (feel) the entire breast, including the armpit. a nurse or assistant might also be in the room during the exam. create a medical binder a medical binder or notebook is a great way to organize all of your records in one place. 3make copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about your specific type of cancer. it will be helpful when getting a second opinion. 3choose a binder that meets your needs. consider a zipper pocket to include a pen, small calendar, and insurance cards. 3create folders for insurance forms, test types (ie, blood, imaging, pathology, radiology, genetics), treatments, and procedures. organize items in the folder by date. 3use online patient portals to view your test results and other records. download or print the records to add to your binder. 3add a section for questions and to take notes. bring your medical binder to appointments. you never know when you might need it! 12 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" fertility (all genders) 12 testing for ibc \" fertility (all genders) \" preventing pregnancy during treatment fertility (all genders) treatment such as chemotherapy can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. if you think you want children in the future, ask your care team how cancer and cancer treatment might change your fertility. to preserve your fertility, you may need to take action before starting cancer treatment. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist to discuss the options before starting treatment. fertility preservation is all about keeping your options open, whether you know you want to have children later in life or aren't really sure at the moment. fertility and reproductive specialists can help you sort through what may be best for your situation. more information on fertility preservation in adolescents and young adults can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. changes in fertility treatment might cause your fertility to be temporarily or permanently impaired or interrupted. this loss of fertility is related to your age at time of diagnosis, treatment type(s), treatment dose, and treatment length. talk to your care team about your concerns and if you are planning a pregnancy. preventing pregnancy during treatment preventing pregnancy during treatment is important. cancer and cancer treatment can affect the ovaries and damage sperm. hormonal birth control may or may not be recommended, so ask your doctor about options such as intrauterine devices (iuds) and barrier methods. types of barrier methods include condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, and the contraceptive sponge. those with ovaries those who can become pregnant will have a pregnancy test before starting treatment. cancer treatment can hurt the developing baby if you are or become pregnant during treatment. therefore, birth control to prevent pregnancy during and after treatment is recommended. non-hormonal birth control methods (barrier methods, iuds) are preferred after a breast cancer diagnosis. if you are pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of your cancer diagnosis, certain treatments will need to be avoided. menstruation, menses, menstrual flow, or your \"period\" may stop during treatment, but often returns within 2 years after treatment in those 35 years of age and under. it is still possible to become pregnant even though you might not have a period. therefore, birth control is recommended during and after treatment. consult your doctor for the best time to plan a pregnancy. those with testicles cancer and cancer treatment can damage sperm. therefore, use contraception (birth control) such as condoms and iuds to prevent 13 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" blood tests pregnancy during and immediately after cancer treatment. blood tests blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. they require a sample of your blood, which is removed through a needle placed into your vein. some blood tests you might have are described next. alkaline phosphatase alkaline phosphatase (alp) is an enzyme found in the blood. high levels of alp can be a sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver. a bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of alp. complete blood count a complete blood count (cbc) measures the levels of red blood cells (rbcs), white blood cells (wbcs), and platelets (plts) in your blood. red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, white blood cells fight infection, and platelets control bleeding. comprehensive metabolic panel a comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp) measures 14 different substances in your blood. it is usually done on the plasma part of your blood. a cmp provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things. liver function tests liver function tests (lfts) look at the health of your liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver. levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or that cancer has spread to the liver. pregnancy test those who can become pregnant will be given a pregnancy test before treatment begins. those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist before starting treatment. 14 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests imaging tests imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. imaging tests show the primary tumor, or where the cancer started, and look for cancer in other parts of the body. a radiologist, an expert in interpreting imaging tests, will write a report and send this report to your doctor. the doctor will discuss the results with you. while these reports are available to you through your patient portal, please wait to discuss these results with the doctor. the following imaging tests are not in order of importance. you will not have all of these tests. bone scan a bone scan uses a radiotracer. a radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation. before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein. it can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones. however, the test is quick and painless. a special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body. areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures. bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health issues. bone x-ray an x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one picture at a time. a tumor changes the way radiation is absorbed and will show up on the x-ray. x-rays are also good at showing bone issues. your care team may order x-rays if your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone scan. diagnostic mammogram a mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast. the pictures are made using x-rays. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. a bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts. mammogram results are used to plan treatment. diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen on screening mammograms. they are used to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s). diagnostic mammograms include extra compression in certain areas of the breast, magnification views, or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast. other tests may include a breast mri or ultrasound. mri scan a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body. it does not use x-rays. because of the very strong magnets used in the mri machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body. during the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images. contrast is often used. a closed mri has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you. an open mri has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end. closed mris are more common than open mris, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it. 15 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests breast mri if needed, a breast mri will be used in addition to a mammogram. contrast should be used. you will be positioned face down in the machine with your arms above your head. spine and brain mri an mri can be used to detect breast cancer that has spread (metastasize) to your spine or brain. for a brain mri, a device is placed around your head. for a spine mri, no device is worn. contrast should be used in an mri. ct scan a computed tomography (ct or cat) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body. it takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles. all the images are combined to make one detailed picture. intravenous (iv) contrast is often used. contrast material contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body. contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body. it is used to make the pictures clearer. the contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine immediately after the test. the types of contrast vary and are different for ct and mri. tell your doctors if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past, especially to iodine or to shellfish such as shrimp. this is important. you might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies. contrast what's the difference between a screening and diagnostic mammogram? a mammogram is a picture of the inside of your breast made using x-rays. during a mammogram, the breast is pressed between two plates while you stand in different positions. multiple x-rays will be taken. a computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures. screening mammograms are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. results take a few days. diagnostic mammograms are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or whose breasts have changed shape or size. diagnostic mammograms are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram. a radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away. both types of mammograms use low-dose x-rays to examine the breast. they may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2d) digital mammography or 3-dimensional (3d) mammograms known as tomosynthesis. 16 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" imaging tests might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren't working well. pet scan a positron emission tomography (pet) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer. a tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow. cancer cells show up as bright spots on pet scans. however, not all tumors will appear on a pet scan. also, not all bright spots are cancer. it is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on pet. inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot. when a pet scan is combined with ct, it is called a pet-ct scan. it may be done with one or two machines depending on the cancer center. sodium fluoride pet-ct a sodium fluoride pet-ct might be used instead of a bone scan. in this test, the radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride. fdg pet-ct an fdg pet-ct uses a radiotracer called f-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (fdg). it is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose. you cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan. this scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear. it may help find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites. if it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride pet-ct may not be needed. fdg pet-ct can be done at the same time as a ct used for diagnosis. fes pet-ct fes is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen. it might be used instead of fdg pet-ct when cancer is estrogen receptor-positive (er+). ultrasound an ultrasound (us) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body. this is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy. a wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your bare breast using gel. it may also be placed below your armpit. ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed. ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that are near the skin. sometimes, a breast ultrasound or mri is used to guide a biopsy. inflammatory breast cancer can be difficult to diagnose. ask for a referral to a breast specialist, if possible. 17 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy biopsy a biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample of tissue or fluid. the sample is sent to a lab for testing. a pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report. ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment. there are different types of biopsies. some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as mammogram, ultrasound, or mri. the primary or main tumor is biopsied first. other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied. you may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both. types of possible biopsies include: +fine-needle aspiration (fna) or core biopsy (cb) uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid. in a vacuum-assisted core biopsy (vacb), suction is used to remove the sample with a special vacuum device. +incisional biopsy removes a small amount of tissue through a cut in the skin or body. +excisional biopsy removes the entire abnormal area. this is not the preferred type of biopsy but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don't match the expected findings. +skin biopsy takes a small sample of inflamed skin on the breast. before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine. a core needle biopsy (cnb) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast. the samples are small. biopsy in a biopsy, a sample of tumor is removed. there are different types of biopsy. this image shows an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy. 18 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy the needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging. when mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy. one or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy. the clips are small, painless, and made of metal. they will mark the site for future treatment and imaging. the clips will stay in place until surgery. if the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging. the clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time. you will be able to go through airport security and have an mri. there are both physical and emotional experiences in having biopsies. you may need to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy area after the procedure. if you are working or have other commitments, you may want to take the day off to recover emotionally and physically from the experience. axillary lymph node needle biopsy an axillary lymph node (aln) drains lymph fluid from the breast and nearby areas. in an axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with a needle. this is to determine if abnormal lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain cancer cells. an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (us-fna) or core biopsy will be used. if cancer is found, it is called node positive (node+). a marker may be placed in the node so that it can be identified later if needed. standard of care is the best known way to treat particular disease based on past clinical trials. there may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care. ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you. 19 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biopsy sentinel lymph node biopsy a sentinel lymph node (sln) is the first lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node. removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb or snb). this procedure is done during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes. the lymph nodes removed are called the sentinel nodes. they may or may not contain any cancer cells. just because these nodes are removed, it does not mean that they are positive for cancer. to find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive material and other dyes are injected into the area where breast tumor is located. from here, the dye travels through the lymphatics in the breast to the lymph nodes. this helps the surgeon find which of the nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes. once the nodes are found, those containing the radioactive material or dye are removed and tested by a pathologist. if cancer is found, then more than the sentinel lymph nodes may be removed. skin biopsy a sample of inflamed skin on the breast will likely be removed to diagnose inflammatory breast cancer. biopsy results histology is the study of the anatomy (structure) of cells, tissues, and organs under a microscope. it is used to make treatment decisions. your pathology report will contain information about histology. you may be recommended to have an open biopsy (surgery) to remove (excise) the tumor to confirm histology. talk to your health care provider for more information on next steps. 20 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" hormone receptor status hormone receptor status a hormone is a substance made by a gland in your body. your blood carries hormones throughout your body. a receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell. substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors. this causes changes within the cell. hormones recognize and bind to specific hormone receptors. when hormones attach to receptors on breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow. if found, these receptors may be targeted using endocrine therapy. there are 2 types of hormone receptors: +estrogen-plays a role in breast development +progesterone-plays a role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy hormone receptor (hr) testing should be done on any new tumors. a biopsy sample will be used. hormone receptor-positive in hormone receptor-positive (hr+) breast cancer, ihc finds estrogen and/or progesterone hormone receptors. most breast cancers are hr+. +estrogen receptor (er) is stimulated by estrogen and provides survival and proliferation (rapid growth) signals. cancer cells deprived of estrogen or which have their er signal blocked with treatment may stop growing or die. +progesterone receptor (pr) binds progesterone and also provides survival and proliferation signals. it is thought that pr expression also suggests the tumor is estrogen dependent. hr+ breast cancer is treated with endocrine therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor signaling. hormone receptor-negative hormone receptor-negative (hr-) breast cancer cells do not have either estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors. these cancers are sometimes simply called hormone negative. hr-cancers often grow faster than hr+ cancers. both the estrogen and progesterone receptors need to be negative for the cancer to be considered hr-. estrogen receptor-positive (er+) breast cancer cells 3in er+ breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells. 3in er-low-positive invasive breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 cancer cells. 3endocrine therapy might not be recommended for er-low-positive invasive breast cancer. 21 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" her2 status 21 testing for ibc \" her2 status \" biomarker testing her2 status inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of her2. human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) is a protein involved in normal cell growth. it is found on the surface of all cells. when amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and divide. some breast cancers have too many her2 genes or receptors. too many her2s is called her2-positive (her2+). you might hear it called her2 overexpression or amplification. there are 2 tests for her2: +immunohistochemistry (ihc) measures receptors. if the ihc score is 3+, the cancer is her2+. if the score is 0 or 1, it is considered her2-. if the score is 2+, further testing is needed. +in situ hybridization (ish) counts the number of copies of the her2 gene. this test is done mainly when the ihc score is unclear. her2 testing should be done on all new tumors. a tumor biopsy sample will be used. you might have more than one her2 test. immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry (ihc) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells. these cells are then studied using a microscope. ihc can find estrogen, progesterone, and her2 receptors in breast cancer cells. a pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen and/ or progesterone receptors and the number of receptors inside each cell. biomarker testing a sample from a biopsy of your tumor may be tested to look for specific dna (deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features. this information is used to choose the best treatment for you. it is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing. biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins). it identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment. proteins are written like this: brca. genes are written with italics like this: brca. her2 and hormone receptor status are part of biomarker testing. your treatment team will recommend the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you. tumor markers your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for proteins. examples of some tumor markers in breast cancer include carcinoembryonic antigen (cea), ca 15-3, and ca 27. 29. an increase in the level of certain tumor markers could mean that the cancer has grown or spread (progressed). however, not everyone has elevated levels of these markers and tumor markers alone are not a reliable method of detecting breast cancer. tumor mutational burden when there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor dna, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (tmb-h). tmb-h can be used to help predict response to cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the proteins called programmed 22 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" biomarker testing death protein 1 (pd-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1). tumor mutation testing a sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific dna mutations. this is a different type of dna testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your parents. in tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body. certain mutations such as pik3ca can be targeted with specific therapies. msi-h/d mmr mutation microsatellites are short, repeated strings of dna. when errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (mmr) proteins. some cancers have dna mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed. this is called microsatellite instability (msi) or deficient mismatch repair (d mmr). when cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called msi-h (microsatellite instability-high). this is often due to d mmr genes. pd-1 and pd-l1 testing programmed death protein 1 (pd-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) are immune proteins. if either protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause your immune cells to ignore the cancer and suppress the anti-tumor immune response. if your cancer expresses either protein, you might have treatment that combines chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor therapy. this is designed to activate your immune system to better fight off the cancer cells. fish fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) is a testing method that involves special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of dna, the genetic material in a person's cells. immunohistochemistry immunohistochemistry (ihc) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cancer or immune cells. the cells are then studied using a microscope. next-generation sequencing next-generation sequencing (ngs) is a high-throughput method used to determine the dna sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in your tumor. this method would only be used if enough tumor tissue remains after other biomarker testing has been completed. pcr a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a lab process that can make millions or billions of copies of your dna (genetic information). pcr is very sensitive. it can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells. these copies called pcr product might be used for ngs. 23 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" genetic risk testing genetic risk testing about 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more about your cancer. a genetic counselor or trained provider will speak to you about the results. tests results may be used to guide treatment planning. genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup or a cheek swab). the goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological parents called germline mutations. some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. you can pass these genes on to your children. also, other family members might carry these mutations. tell your care team if there is a family history of cancer. brca tests everyone has brca genes. normal brca genes help to prevent tumor growth. they help fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally. brca mutations put you at risk for more than one type of cancer. mutations in brca1 or brca2 increase the risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, and melanoma skin cancers. mutated brca genes can also affect how well some treatments work. these tests might be repeated. what is your family cancer health history? some cancers and other diseases run in families--those who are related to you through genes passed down from biological parent to child. this information is called a family health history. ask blood relatives about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed. for relatives who were diagnosed with cancer, ask them (or other relatives if they are no longer living) what type of cancer they had, if they died from the cancer, and at what age the cancer was diagnosed. start by asking your parents, siblings, and children. next, talk to half-siblings, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, grandparents, and grandchildren. write down what you learn about your family history and share this information with your health care provider. some of the questions to ask include: 3how old were you when each of these diseases and health conditions was diagnosed? 3what is our family's ancestry-from what countries did our ancestors originate? 24 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" distress screening 24 testing for ibc \" distress screening \" key points distress screening it is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer and your feelings can also change from day to day and week to week. talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. there are services and people who can help you. support and counseling are available. dealing with a cancer diagnosis may sometimes be stressful and may cause distress. your treatment team will screen your level of distress. this is part of your cancer care. distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature. it can affect how you feel, think, and act. distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt. you may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues. more information on distress can be found at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. performance status performance status (ps) is a person's general level of fitness and ability to perform daily tasks. your state of general health will be rated using a ps scale called ecog (eastern cooperative oncology group). ps is one factor taken into consideration when choosing a treatment plan. your preferences about treatment are always important. ecog ps the ecog ps scores range from 0 to 5. +ps 0 means the person is fully active. +ps 1 means the person is still able to perform light to moderate activity, but with some limitations. +ps 2 means the person is limited to the chair or bed less than half of the time and is still able to care for self. +ps 3 means the person is limited to the chair or bed more than half of the time. +ps 4 means the person is totally confined to the bed or chair and completely unable to care for self. +ps 5 means the person is not alive. in breast cancer, ps might be referred to as good or poor. good ps is usually ps 0 or ps 1. 25 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023testing for ibc \" key points key points +tests are used to find cancer, plan treatment, and check how well treatment is working. +you will have a physical exam, including a breast exam, to see if anything feels or looks abnormal. +treatment can affect your fertility, the ability to have children. +blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working. +imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body. +a diagnostic mammogram includes detailed pictures of both breasts. it is different than a screening mammogram. +during a biopsy, tissue or fluid samples are removed for testing. samples are needed to confirm the presence of cancer and to perform cancer cell tests. +a sample from a biopsy of your tumor will be tested for estrogen receptor (er) status, progesterone receptor (pr) status, her2 status, and grade (histology). this provides information about the behavior of your cancer, as well as treatments to which your cancer may respond. +about 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary. depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing or to speak with a genetic counselor. +a sentinel lymph node (sln) is the first lymph node(s) that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor. a sentinel lymph node biopsy (snlb) might be done to look for cancer in your lymph node(s). +online portals are a great way to access your test results. testing takes time. it might take days or weeks before all test results come in. 26 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 20233 breast cancer staging 27 how breast cancer is staged 28 tnm scores 31 key points 27 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" how breast cancer is staged cancer staging is used to reflect prognosis and to guide treatment decisions. it describes the size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body. it also takes into account hormone receptor and her2 status. most inflammatory breast cancers (ibcs) are invasive ductal carcinomas. this means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue. at diagnosis, ibc is stage 3 or 4 disease. in stage 3, the tumor can be any size and in the lymph nodes, the lymph nodes can be fixed (or not moveable), or the cancer can involve the skin or chest wall. it is sometimes called advanced disease. in stage 4, cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized). how breast cancer is staged a cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed. the american joint committee on cancer (ajcc) created a staging system to determine how much cancer is in your body, where it is located, and what subtype you have. this is called staging. based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage. staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions. a prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take. ajcc is just one type of staging system. staging includes: +anatomic- based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (t), lymph node status (n), and distant metastasis (m). +prognostic -includes anatomic tnm plus tumor grade and the status of the biomarkers such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2), estrogen receptor (er), and progesterone receptor (pr). prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches. prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic. pathologic stage applies to those who have undergone surgery as the initial treatment for breast cancer. breast cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery. staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status. +clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment. it is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests. an example might look like c n2 or c m1. +pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery. an example might be p n2. if you are given drug therapy before surgery, then the stage might look like yp t3. staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage. often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation. more information can be gathered as treatment begins. doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next. 28 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores information gathered during staging: +the extent (size) of the tumor (t): how large is the cancer? has it grown into nearby areas? +the spread to nearby lymph nodes (n): has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes? if so, how many? where? +the spread (metastasis) to distant sites (m): has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver? +estrogen receptor (er) status: does the cancer have the protein called an estrogen receptor? +progesterone receptor (pr) status: does the cancer have the protein called a progesterone receptor? +human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) status: does the cancer make too much of a protein called her2? +grade of the cancer (g): how much do the cancer cells look like normal cells? +biomarker testing: does the cancer have any genes, proteins, markers, or mutations that might suggest treatment?tnm scores the tumor, node, metastasis (tnm) system is used to stage breast cancer. in this system, the letters t, n, and m describe different areas of cancer growth. based on cancer test results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter. the higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread. these scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage. a tnm example might look like this: t3n2m0 or t32, n2, m0. +t (tumor)-depth and spread of the main (primary) tumor(s) in one or both breasts +n (node) -if cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes +m (metastasis)--if cancer has spread to distant parts of the body or metastasized t = tumor the primary tumor size can be measured in centimeters (cm) or millimeters (mm). one inch is equal to 2. 54 cm. a large pea is 1 cm (10 mm). a golf ball is 4 cm (40 mm). a tumor micrometastasis is a very small collection of cancerous cells smaller than 1 mm. it might be written as t1mi. ipsilateral means on the same side of the body. +t1 tumor is 2 cm (20 mm) or less +t2 tumor is 2. 1 cm to 5 cm +t3 tumor is more than 5 cm +t4 tumor is of any size and has invaded nearby structures such as the chest wall and skin of the breast t4d tumor is inflammatory carcinoma (inflammatory breast cancer) 29 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores n = regional lymph node lymph, a clear fluid containing cells that help fight infections and other diseases, drains through channels into lymphatic vessels. from here, lymph drains into lymph nodes. there are hundreds of lymph nodes throughout your body. they work as filters to help fight infection and remove harmful things from your body. regional lymph nodes are those located near the tumor in the breast. if breast cancer spreads, it often goes first to nearby lymph nodes under the arm. it can also sometimes spread to lymph nodes near the collarbone or near the breastbone. knowing if the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes helps doctors find the best way to treat your cancer. +n0 means no cancer is in the regional lymph nodes. isolated tumor cells (itcs) may be present. these are malignant cell clusters no larger than 0. 2 mm. +n1mi means micrometastases (approximately 200 cells, larger than 0. 2 mm, but not larger than 2. 0 mm) are found in lymph nodes. +n1, n2, n3 means regional lymph node metastases are found. the higher the number, the more lymph nodes that have metastases. m = metastasis cancer that has spread to distant parts of the body is shown as m1. this is metastatic breast cancer (mbc). the most common sites for metastasis are bone and lung. +m0 means no evidence of distant metastasis. +m1 means distant metastasis is found. this is metastatic breast cancer. clinical staging clinical staging of lymph nodes is staging before surgery. cancer is in axillary nodes cancer is in internal mammary nodes cancer is in infraclavicular nodes cancer is in supraclavicular nodes 30 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023breast cancer staging \" tnm scores grade grade describes how abnormal the tumor cells look under a microscope (called histology). higher-grade cancers tend to grow and spread faster than lower-grade cancers. gx means the grade can't be determined, followed by g1, g2, and g3. g3 is the highest grade for breast cancers. a low-grade tumor has a low risk of recurrence. a high-grade tumor has a higher risk of recurrence (of cancer returning). +gx-grade cannot be determined +g1-low +g2-intermediate +g3-high numbered stages numbered stages are based on tnm scores and receptor (hormone and her2) status. stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4 being the most advanced. they might be written as stage 0, stage i, stage ii, stage iii, and stage iv. stage 0 is noninvasive noninvasive breast cancer is rated stage 0. ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis) is found only in the ducts (tis). it has not spread to the surrounding breast tissue, lymph nodes (n0) or distant sites (m0). stages 1, 2, and 3 are invasive invasive breast cancer is rated stage 1, 2, or 3. it has grown outside the ducts, lobules, or breast skin. cancer might be in the axillary lymph nodes. stage 4 is metastatic in stage 4 breast cancer, cancer has spread to distant sites. it can develop from earlier stages. sometimes, the first diagnosis is stage 4 metastatic breast cancer (called de novo). more information on metastatic breast cancer is available at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. 31 nccn guidelines for

this chapter provides an overview of treatment options and what to expect. together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. care team treating breast cancer takes a team approach. treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (mdt). an mdt is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer. this team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment. ask who will coordinate your care. some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. depending on your diagnosis, the care team might include the following: +a diagnostic radiologist interprets the results of mammograms, ultrasounds, and other imaging tests. +an interventional radiologist performs needle biopsies and places intravenous (iv) ports for treatment. +a pathologist analyzes the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy and provides cancer diagnosis, staging, and information about biomarker testing. +a surgical oncologist performs operations to remove cancer. +a reconstructive (plastic) surgeon performs breast reconstruction, if desired, for those who undergo mastectomy. +a medical oncologist treats cancer in adults using systemic therapy. +a radiation oncologist prescribes and delivers radiation therapy to treat cancer. +an anesthesiologist gives anesthesia, a medicine so you do not feel pain during surgery or procedures. +residents and fellows are doctors who are continuing their training, some to become specialists in a certain field of medicine. +nurse practitioners (nps) and physician assistants (pas) are health care providers. some of your clinic visits may be done by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. +oncology nurses provide your hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy, managing your care, answering questions, and helping you cope with side effects. +oncology pharmacists are experts in knowing how to use medicines to treat cancer and to manage symptoms and side effects. +palliative care nurses, advanced practice providers (apps), and physicians help provide an extra layer of support with cancer-related care. +radiation therapists provide your hands-on delivery of radiotherapy treatments. 34 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" treatment overview +nutritionists and dietitians can provide guidance on what foods are most suitable for your condition. +psychologists and psychiatrists are mental health experts who can help manage issues such as depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions that can affect how you think and feel. +social workers help people solve and cope with problems in their everyday lives. clinical social workers also diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional issues. the anxiety a person feels when diagnosed with cancer might be managed by a social worker in some cancer centers. they, or other designated professionals, can help navigate the complexities of financial and insurance stresses. +a research team helps to collect research data and coordinate care if you are in a clinical trial. clinical trials help bring new therapies to patients and advance the treatment for everyone. consider asking your care team about access to clinical trials. your physical, mental, and emotional well-being are important. help other team members understand: +how you feel +what you need +what is working and what is not keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team. this will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know whom to contact with questions or concerns. treatment overview inflammatory breast cancer is treatable. treatment can be local, systemic, or usually a combination of both. local therapy focuses on the breast, chest wall, and lymph node area. it includes: +mastectomy (surgery) +radiation therapy systemic therapy works throughout the body. it includes: +chemotherapy +her2-targeted therapy +inhibitors +immunotherapy +endocrine therapy for a list of systemic therapies, see guide 2. get to know your care team and help them get to know you. 35 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" treatment overview ibc is treated with systemic therapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the breast and lymph nodes, and then radiation therapy. surgery is not always possible. even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue. systemic treatment is based on estrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr), and her2 expression. it is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan. there are many treatment options. however, not everyone will respond to treatment in the same way. some people will do better than expected. others will do worse. many factors play a role in how the cancer will respond to treatment.

combination therapy of trastuzumab with pertuzumab 36 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" mastectomy mastectomy surgery is an operation or procedure to remove cancer from the body. a mastectomy removes all or part of the breast. inflammatory breast cancer is often treated with a modified radical mastectomy. in a modified radical mastectomy, the breast and underarm (axilla) sentinel lymph nodes are removed. before removing the breast, the surgeon may do a sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb). sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes cancer cells are likely to have spread from the primary tumor. breast reconstruction is an option after a mastectomy. if you opt for reconstruction, it will be done after finishing cancer treatment. this is called delayed reconstruction. breast reconstruction is often done in stages. you might want to consult with a plastic surgeon. when preparing for surgery, seek the opinion of an experienced surgeon. the surgeon should be an expert in performing your type of surgery. hospitals that perform many surgeries often have better results. you can ask for a referral to a hospital or cancer center that has experience in treating your type of cancer. radiation therapy radiation therapy (rt) uses high-energy radiation from x-rays, photons, protons, and other sources to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. radiation therapy can be given alone or before or after surgery to treat or slow the growth of cancer. sometimes, radiation is given with certain systemic therapies. it may be used as supportive care to help ease pain or discomfort caused by cancer. most types of radiation include several short treatment modified radical mastectomy the dotted line shows where the entire breast and some lymph nodes are removed. part of the chest wall muscle may also be removed. 37 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" chemotherapy 37 treating ibc \" chemotherapy \" chemotherapy sessions that are given once daily over a few days to weeks. ask your care team which radiation option(s) are best for you and what side effects to expect. radiation may be given to the chest wall, infraclavicular region (below the collarbone), supraclavicular area (above the collarbone), or lymph nodes found in the axillary bed (armpit). lymph node radiation therapy is also called regional nodal irradiation (rni) external beam radiation therapy external beam radiation therapy (ebrt) uses a machine outside of the body called a linear accelerator (linac) to aim radiation at the whole breast (wbrt) and lymph nodes (rni). chemotherapy systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body. it is used before surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of cancer (called cancer burden). +preoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given before surgery. it is also called neoadjuvant therapy. +postoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given after surgery. it is also called adjuvant therapy. chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and some normal cells. more than one chemotherapy may be used to treat inflammatory breast cancer. when only one drug is used, it's called a single agent. a combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs. warnings about supplements and drug interactions you might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy. some supplements can affect the ability of a drug to do its job. this is called a drug interaction. it is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking. some examples include: +turmeric +gingko biloba +green tea extract +st. john's wort +antioxidants certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job. antacids, heart or blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy. therefore, it is very important to tell your care team about any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter (otc) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking. bring a list with you to every visit. 38 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" myeloid growth factors some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein or injected under the skin with a needle. other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed. some examples of chemotherapy drugs include: +doxorubicin (adriamcyin), doxorubicin liposomal injection (doxil), and epirubicin (ellence) are anthracyclines. +docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel are taxanes. +capecitabine (xeloda), fluorouracil, gemcitabine (gemzar, infugem), and methotrexate are antimetabolites. most chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest. this allows the body to recover before the next cycle. cycles vary in length depending on which drugs are used. the number of treatment days per cycle and the total number of cycles given also vary. myeloid growth factors certain chemotherapies can reduce the cells that fight infection. treatments with myeloid growth factors (mgfs) can help increase the number of white blood cells and prevent infections. more information on myeloid growth factors, can be found in the nccn guidelines for patients: anemia and neutropenia, at nccn. org/patientguidelines and on the nccn patient guides for cancer app. her2-targeted therapy her2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. there might be higher amounts of her2 in your breast cancer. if this is the case, it is called her2-positive (her2+) breast cancer. her2-targeted therapy is drug therapy that treats her2+ breast cancer. most often, her2-targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy. however, it might be used alone or in combination with endocrine therapy. her2-targeted therapies include: +her2 antibodies prevent growth signals from her2 from outside the cell. they also increase the attack of immune cells on cancer cells. +her2 inhibitors stop growth signals from her2 from within the cell. +her2 conjugates or antibody drug conjugates (adcs) deliver cell- specific chemotherapy. they attach to her2s then enter the cell. once inside, chemotherapy is released. your heart will be monitored before and during treatment with trastuzumab. tests will measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef), the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart. 39 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" inhibitors 39 treating ibc \" inhibitors \" immunotherapy inhibitors this section is for inhibitors that are different from inhibitors used in her2-targeted therapy. cdk4/6 inhibitors cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. for hormone receptor-positive (hr+), her2-cancer, taking a cdk4/6 inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help control cancer longer. with all cdk4/6 regimens, those who are premenopausal must also receive ovarian ablation or suppression. cdk4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib (verzenio), palbociclib (ibrance), and ribociclib (kisqali). m tor inhibitors m tor is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide. endocrine therapy may stop working if m tor becomes overactive. m tor inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy working again. everolimus (afinitor) is an m tor inhibitor. most often, it is taken with exemestane. for some, it may be taken with fulvestrant or tamoxifen. parp inhibitors cancer cells often become damaged. parp is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and allows them to survive. blocking parp can cause cancer cells to die. olaparib (lynparza) and talazoparib (talzenna) are parp inhibitors. you must have the brca1 or brca2 mutation and your breast cancer must be her2-for parp inhibitors to be considered. pik3ca inhibitor the pik3ca gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancers. a mutation in this gene can lead to increased growth of cancer cells and resistance to various treatments. alpelisib (piqray) is an example of a pik3ca inhibitor. immunotherapy immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment that tries to re-activate the immune system against tumor cells. the immune system has many on and off switches. tumors take advantage of \"off switches. \" two leading off switches are pd-1 and ctla4. immunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment. an immunotherapy example is pembrolizumab (keytruda). did you know? the terms \"chemotherapy\" and \"systemic therapy\" are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same. systemic therapy works throughout the body and includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, and others. 40 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" endocrine therapy endocrine therapy endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or progesterone to treat hormone receptor-positive (hr+) breast cancer. the endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. hormones are natural chemicals released into the bloodstream. there are 4 hormones that might be targeted in endocrine therapy: +estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries, and also by other tissues in the body such as the fat tissue. +progesterone is made mainly by the ovaries. +luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (lhrh) is made by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. it tells the ovaries to make estrogen and progesterone and testicles to make testosterone. lhrh is also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh). +androgen is made by the adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries. hormones may cause breast cancer to grow. endocrine therapy will stop your body from making hormones or it will block what hormones do in the body. this can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time. endocrine therapy is sometimes called hormone therapy. it is not the same as hormone replacement therapy used for menopause. there is one type of surgical endocrine therapy: +bilateral oophorectomy is surgery to remove both ovaries. other main types of endocrine therapy include: +ovarian ablation uses radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones. +ovarian suppression uses drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries from making hormones. it is achieved with drugs called lhrh agonists. these drugs stop lhrh from being made, which stops the ovaries from making hormones. lhrh agonists include goserelin (zoladex) and leuprolide (lupron depot). gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh) agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. +aromatase inhibitors (ais) stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase. they do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries. non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole (arimidex) and letrozole (femara). exemestane (aromasin) is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor. +estrogen receptor (er) modulators or anti-estrogens prevent hormones from binding to receptors. serms and serds are types of er modulators. selective estrogen receptor modulators (serms) block estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors. they include tamoxifen and toremifene (fareston). selective estrogen receptor degraders (serds) block and destroy estrogen receptors. fulvestrant (faslodex) and elacestrant (orserdu) are serds. 41 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" endocrine therapy +gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn rh) agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. +hormones may be used to treat breast cancer when taken in high doses. it is not known how hormones stop breast cancer from growing. they include ethinyl estradiol, fluoxymesterone, and megestrol acetate (megace es). those who want to have children in the future should be referred to a fertility specialist before starting endocrine therapy to discuss the options. testosterone for those assigned male at birth whose bodies continue to make testosterone, endocrine therapy includes tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor with testosterone-suppressing therapy. premenopause if you have menstrual periods, you are in premenopause. in premenopause, the ovaries are the main source of estrogen and progesterone. menstrual periods may stop during treatment (called amenorrhea) and for up to 2 years after treatment, but often return in those 35 years of age and under. endocrine therapy bilateral oophorectomy surgery to remove both ovaries. ovarian ablation radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones. ovarian or testosterone suppression drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries or testicles from making

producing hormones and menstrual periods stop. estrogen and progesterone levels are low, but, the adrenal glands, liver, and body fat continue to make small amounts of estrogen. if you don't have periods, a test using a blood sample may be used to confirm your status. cancer treatment can cause a temporary menopause. tamoxifen is the endocrine treatment for those in premenopause. gn rh agonists may be used to temporarily induce menopause for those in premenopause. combination of gn rh agonists and tamoxifen/aromatase inhibitors may be considered as endocrine therapy for those in premenopause. ovarian suppression or ablation is frequently considered for higher risk er+ breast cancers. bone-strengthening therapy medicines that target the bones may be given to help relieve bone pain or reduce the risk of bone problems. some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness. when breast cancer spreads to distant sites, it may metastasize in your bones. this puts your bones at risk for injury and disease. such problems include bone loss (osteoporosis), fractures, bone pain, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. some treatments for breast cancer, like aromatase inhibitors or gn rh agonists, can cause bone loss, which put you at an increased risk for fractures. \"my 3-month-old son stopped nursing on my left breast and it was swollen and painful. the doctor said it was mastitis, but this didn't feel the same as when i'd had that before. even with the antibiotic, it didn't improve. an ultrasound showed a questionable area in that breast and a biopsy confirmed inflammatory breast cancer (ibc). \" 43 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" clinical trials

+pamidronate (aredia) +denosumab (xgeva) you will be screened for bone weakness (osteoporosis) using a bone mineral density test. this measures how much calcium and other minerals are in your bones. it is also called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) scan and is painless. bone mineral density tests look for osteoporosis and help predict your risk for bone fractures. a baseline dexa scan is recommended before starting endocrine therapy. zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab zoledronic acid, pamidronate, and denosumab are used to prevent bone loss (osteoporosis) and fractures. zoledronic acid and denosumab are also used in those with metastatic breast cancer who have bone metastases to help reduce the likelihood of fractures, pain, or other complications arising from cancer in bone. ou might have blood tests to monitor kidney function, calcium levels, and magnesium levels. a calcium and vitamin d supplement will be recommended by your doctor. let your dentist know if you are taking any of these medicines. also, ask your care team how these medicines might affect your teeth and jaw. osteonecrosis, or bone tissue death of the jaw, is a rare but serious side effect. tell your care team about any planned trips to the dentist and surgeries or dental procedures that might also affect the jaw bone. it will be important to take care of your teeth and to see a dentist before starting treatment with any of these drugs. clinical trials a clinical trial is a type of medical research study. after being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of treating cancer need to be studied in people. if found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the u. s. food and drug administration (fda). everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials. talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you. phases most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment. treatment trials are done in phases. +phase i trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach. they also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful. +phase ii trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer. +phase iii trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment. if 44 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" clinical trials the results are good, it may be approved by the fda. +phase iv trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an fda-approved treatment. who can enroll? every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria. the rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health. these requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants. informed consent clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team. the research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining. all of this information is also provided in an informed consent form. read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it.

clinical trials. the possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer. will i get a placebo? placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials. it is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment, or a new drug with a standard treatment. you will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll. do i have to pay to be in a clinical trial? rarely. it depends on the study, your health insurance, and the state in which you live. in general, procedures, drugs, or tests that are considered standard of care will be billed to you or your insurance, whereas those considered research are covered by the trial sponsor. your treatment team and the research team can help determine if you are responsible for any costs. supportive care supportive care will be specific to your needs. supportive care is health care given to prevent, reduce, and relieve suffering, and to improve quality of life. supportive care might include pain relief, palliative care, emotional or spiritual support, financial aid, or family counseling. tell your care team how you are feeling and about any side effects so they can be managed. best supportive care, supportive care, and palliative care are often used interchangeably. it is very important to take care of yourself by eating well, drinking plenty of fluids, exercising, and doing things that make you feel energized. strength is needed to sustain you during treatment. side effects all cancer treatments can cause unwanted health issues called side effects. side effects depend on many factors. these factors include the drug type and dose, length of treatment, and the person. some side effects may be harmful to your health. others may just be unpleasant. treatment can cause several side effects. some are very serious. ask for a complete list of side effects of your treatments. also, tell your treatment team about any new or worsening symptoms. there may be ways to help you feel better. there are also ways to prevent some side effects. you will be monitored closely for side effects. late effects late effects are side effects that occur months or years after a disease is diagnosed or after treatment has ended. late effects may be caused by cancer or cancer treatment. they may include physical, mental, and social problems, and second cancers. the sooner it is important to tell your care team about all side effects so they can be managed. 46 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023treating ibc \" side effects late effects are treated the better. ask your care team about what late effects could occur. this will help you know what to look for. survivorship a person is a cancer survivor from the time of diagnosis until the end of life. when treatment leads to remission (or no evidence of disease), you will need follow-up or survivorship care for late effects. during survivorship care you will still have a care team, but it will look different. seek out peer support groups, whether online or in-person. side effects blood clots cancer or cancer treatment can cause blood clots to form. this can block blood flow and oxygen in the body. blood clots can break loose and travel to other parts of the body causing stroke or other health issues. venous thromboembolism (vte) refers to blood clots in the veins. bone health breast cancer may spread to your bones. some breast cancer treatments may also weaken your bones. both can put your bones at increased risk for injury and disease. such problems include bone fractures, bone pain, and squeezing (compression) of the spinal cord. high levels of calcium in the blood, called hypercalcemia, may also occur. medicine may be given to help relieve bone pain and reduce the risk of other bone problems. some medicines work by slowing or stopping bone breakdown, while others help increase bone thickness. it is recommended that you take calcium and vitamin d with these bone health medicines. talk to your doctor first. diarrhea diarrhea is frequent and watery bowel movements. your care team will tell you how to manage diarrhea. it is important to drink lots of fluids. difficulty eating sometimes side effects from surgery, cancer, or its treatment might cause you to feel not hungry or sick to your stomach

drinking enough fluids. a registered dietitian who is an expert in nutrition and food can help. speak to your care team if you have trouble eating or maintaining weight. distress depression, anxiety, and sleeping issues are common and are a normal part of cancer diagnosis. talk to your care team and with those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling. there are services, people, and medicine that can help you. support and counseling services are available. fatigue fatigue is extreme tiredness and inability to function due to lack of energy. fatigue may be caused by cancer or it may be a side effect of treatment. let your care team know how you are feeling and if fatigue is getting in the way of doing the things you enjoy. eating a balanced diet, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, and massage therapy can help. you might be referred to a nutritionist or dietitian to help with fatigue. hair loss chemotherapy may cause hair loss (alopecia) all over your body -- not just on your scalp. some chemotherapy drugs are more likely than others to cause hair loss. dosage might also affect the amount of hair loss. most of the time, hair loss from chemotherapy is temporary. hair often regrows 3 to 6 months after treatment ends. your hair may be a different shade or texture. scalp cooling (or scalp hypothermia) might help lessen hair loss in those receiving certain types of chemotherapy. keep a pain diary a pain diary is a written record that helps you keep track of when you have pain, how bad it is, what causes it, and what makes it better or worse. use a pain diary to discuss your pain with your care team. you might be referred to a specialist for pain management. include in your pain diary: 3the time and dose of all medicines 3when pain starts and ends or lessens 3where you feel pain 3a description of your pain. is it throbbing, sharp, tingling, shooting, or burning? is it constant, or does it come and go? 3does the pain change at different

+anemia is a condition where your body does not have enough healthy blood cells, resulting in less oxygen being carried to your cells. you might tire easily if you are anemic. +neutropenia is a decrease in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. this puts you at risk for infection. +thrombocytopenia is a condition where there are not enough platelets found in the blood. this puts you at risk for bleeding. lymphedema lymphedema is a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling (edema). it may occur when part of the lymph system is damaged or blocked, such as during surgery to remove lymph nodes or due to radiation therapy. swelling usually develops slowly over time. it may develop during treatment or it may start years after treatment. if you have lymphedema, you may be referred to an expert in lymphedema management. the swelling may be reduced by exercise, massage, compression sleeves, and other means. ask your care team about the ways to treat lymphedema. nausea and vomiting nausea and vomiting are common side effects of treatment. you will be given medicine to prevent nausea and vomiting. neurocognitive or neuropsychological effects some treatments can damage the nervous system (neurotoxicity) causing problems with concentration, memory, and thinking. survivors are at risk for neurotoxicity and might be recommended for neuropsychological testing. neuropsychology looks at how the health of your brain affects your thinking and behavior. neuropsychological testing can identify your limits and a health care professional can create a plan to help with these limits. neuropathy neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. it usually begins in the hands or feet and gets worse over time. neuropathy may be caused by cancer or cancer treatment. most of the time, neuropathy goes away after treatment. organ issues treatment might cause your kidneys, liver, heart, and pancreas to not work as well as they should. pain tell your care team about any pain or discomfort. you might meet with a palliative care specialist or with a pain

and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you. overview since ibc spreads quickly, treatment starts with systemic therapy to stop the spread of cancer. if the cancer responds to treatment, then surgery is performed to remove the breast and lymph nodes (modified radical mastectomy) for those assigned female at birth with stage 3 cancer. this is followed by radiation to the chest wall. if you choose breast reconstruction after a mastectomy with radiation, then delayed breast reconstruction is recommended. radiation can slow the healing process. therefore, delayed reconstruction is recommended after all the healing from radiation is done. like other breast cancers, ibc can develop in those assigned male at birth. treatment for ibc starts with preoperative systemic therapy. preoperative therapy is treatment given before surgery. it is based on the expression of estrogen receptor (er) and her2 in your tumor cells. cancer can still progress during preoperative systemic therapy. order of treatments most people with cancer will receive more than one type of treatment. below is an overview of the order of treatments. 3preoperative or neoadjuvant (before) therapy is given to shrink the tumor before a primary treatment such as surgery. 3perioperative therapy is systemic therapy, such as chemotherapy, given before and after surgery. 3primary treatment is the main treatment given to rid the body of cancer. 3postoperative or adjuvant (after) therapy is given after primary treatment to rid the body of any cancer cells left behind from surgery. it is also used when the risk of cancer returning (recurrence) is felt to be high. 3first-line therapy is the first set of systemic (drug) treatment given. 3second-line therapy is the next set of treatment given if cancer progresses during or after systemic therapy. talk to your care team about your treatment plan and what it means for your stage and type of cancer. 52 nccn guidelines

nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" flat closure the look of your breast after mastectomy will depend on factors such as your body type, age, and size and shape of the area before surgery. this chapter offers more information on flat closure and breast reconstruction. the recovery time for each procedure differs. this can affect your ability to return to work or participate in activities. you might consider speaking with a plastic surgeon before surgery to discuss your options and what to expect. if breast construction is something you might want, delayed reconstruction is recommended in those with ibc. flat closure in a total mastectomy with a flat closure, the entire breast, including nipple, extra skin, fat, and other tissue in the breast area are removed. the remaining skin is tightened and sewn together. no breast mound is created and no implant is added. the scar will be slightly raised and differ in color than the surrounding skin. a flat closure is not completely flat or smooth. the end result varies from person to person. ask to look at \"after\" pictures from flat closures so you know what to expect. you might decide to have a flat closure procedure at a later time or after having breast implants removed. talk to your care team to learn more. your preferences about treatment are always important. talk to your care team and make your wishes known. 60 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" breast reconstruction 60 the breast after surgery \" breast reconstruction \" nipple replacement breast reconstruction breast reconstruction is surgery to rebuild the shape and look of the breast after a mastectomy. in many cases, breast reconstruction involves a staged approach. it might require more than one procedure. if breast construction is something you might want, delayed reconstruction is recommended in those with ibc. delayed reconstruction can occur months or years after mastectomy. a plastic surgeon performs breast reconstruction. breasts can be reconstructed with implants and flaps. all methods are generally safe, but as with any surgery, there are risks. ask your treatment team for a complete list of side effects. implants breast implants are small bags filled with salt water, silicone gel, or both. they are placed under the breast skin or muscle to look like a new breast following a mastectomy. a balloon-like device, called an expander, may be used first to stretch out tissue. it will be placed under your skin or muscle and enlarged every few weeks for two to three months. when your skin is stretched to the proper size, you will have surgery to place the final implant. implants have a small risk of leaking or causing other issues. you may feel pain from the implant or expander. scar tissue or tissue death can occur. textured implants can cause breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (bia-alcl), a type of cancer. flaps breasts can be remade using tissue from other parts of your body, known as flaps. these flaps are taken from the abdomen, buttocks, thigh, or from under the shoulder blade. some flaps are completely removed and then sewn in place. other flaps stay attached to your body but are slid over and sewn into place. there are several risks associated with flaps, including death of fat in the flap, which can cause lumps. a hernia may result from muscle weakness. problems are more likely to occur among those who have diabetes or who smoke. implants and flaps some breasts are reconstructed with both implants and flaps. this method may give the reconstructed breast more volume to match the other breast. for any reconstruction, you may need surgery on your remaining breast to match the two breasts in size and shape. nipple replacement like your breast, a nipple can be remade. to rebuild a nipple, a plastic surgeon can use surrounding tissues. also, nipples can be remade with tissue from the thigh or the other nipple. tissue can be darkened with a tattoo to look more like a nipple. it is important to note that while you can remake something to look like a nipple, it will not have the sensation of your real nipple. also, a tattoo can be done to look like a nipple without having to take tissue from another part of the body. 61 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer, 2023the breast after surgery \" what to consider what to consider some things to consider when deciding to have flat closure or reconstruction after mastectomy: +your desire -you may have a strong feeling towards flat closure or one form of reconstruction after being given the options. breast reconstruction should be a shared decision between you and your care team. make your wishes known. +health issues-you may have health issues such as diabetes or a blood disorder that might affect or delay healing, or make longer procedures unsafe. +tobacco use-smoking delays wound healing and can cause mastectomy flap death (necrosis), nipple-areola complex (nac) necrosis in a nipple-sparing mastectomy, infection, and failure of implant-based reconstruction. in free flap reconstruction, smoking increases the risk of complications. you are encouraged to stop smoking prior to reconstruction. +breast size and shape-there are limits to the available sizes of breast implants. very large breasts or breasts that lack tone or droop (called ptosis) might be difficult to match. breast reduction surgery might be an option. +body mass index (bmi) -those with an elevated bmi have an increased risk of infections and complications with breast reconstruction. if you smoke or vape, seek help to quit smoking or vaping nicotine greatly increases your chances of having side effects during and after surgery. smoking and vaping can limit how well cancer treatment works and prevent wound healing. they also increase your chances of developing other cancers. marijuana use might also affect the amount of anesthesia used during surgery. nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes you want to keep smoking and vaping. nicotine withdrawal is challenging for most people who smoke or vape. the stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit. if you smoke or vape, ask your care team about counseling and medicines to help you quit. for online support, try these websites: smoke free. gov be tobacco free. gov cdc. gov/tobacco 62 nccn guidelines for patients\u00ae\ufe0f inflammatory breast cancer,
